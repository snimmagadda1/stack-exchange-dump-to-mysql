It is not relevant to the current sociology of the discipline.  Much as some academics would prefer that their view be given exclusive appreciation, linguistics today is a big tent which encompasses a variety of theoretical approaches.  Furthermore, it is becoming more rather than less allied with disciplines like computer science, psychology, evolutionary biology (etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will admit to being biased by my background – that of a graduate student at an institution (Penn) where the culture is heavily biases towards cooperation across disciplinary boundaries as well as traditional rifts such as those evoked by the term &quot;Linguistics Wars.&quot;  Chomsky and Labov (widely regarded as being generals of two warring armies) gave the two keynotes at a conference here last year.  Chomsky was a little down on (of all things) computational linguistics, and a few computational linguists [replied][1].  This is far from a war, however, and I think that a large majority of professional linguists would concur in that view.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question could be re-asked constructively as (e.g.) &quot;what are current trends in linguistics research?&quot;  (Edit: which I see Mitch suggested as an alternate formulation in the comments for the linked question; I probably inadvertently calqued my suggestion from his.)  There are interesting things to be said about this (new trends in computational linguistics, the &quot;experimental syntax&quot; movement, large-scale analysis of sociolinguistic data via social media...).

A question is a good candidate for community wiki if it does not have a unique answer &amp;mdash; but that doesn't mean that any question that doesn't have a unique answer is a reasonable community wiki question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a question has room for multiple, **parallel** (as opposed to, well, opposing) answers, then it is a good community wiki question. And why wouldn't we encourage that? For a topic such as the &quot;linguistics wars&quot;, good answers would be statements as to the points of contention with neutral descriptions of the leading theories, *without editorializing about those theories*. A good community wiki question is one which has no unique answer, but *which does have good answers* &amp;mdash; ones which are short, and not extremely contentious.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What problem does such discussion solve? ***It's high-density expert-level information!*** And if properly done, *i.e.*&amp;nbsp;objectively and in good faith, it can be invaluable. That to me is what StackExchange does best: it should not be mistaken for exclusively &quot;solving problems&quot;, but the somewhat more general function of *providing high-quality answers*. The question should always, and only, be whether **at least** one good answer exists to a question; and CW is the tool for those cases when it is clear that the question happens to be one for which there will not be a &quot;best answer&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To reject one variety of answerable question just because it has sometimes been abused is not unlike stopping StackExchange because not all proposals are well-moderated.

Unfortunately, a site with lots of basic questions will not attract researchers. A prime example is physics.SE which disappointed the research physicists enough that a separate theoreticalphysics.SE (currently in private beta) was created. The only non-beta research SE is cstheory.SE which works very hard to close non-research level questions specifically to keep the questions at a high level (since non-research questions are so easy to ask and would drown the research community quickly). This has made the site very useful for the theoretical computer science community, but maybe not as useful (or popular) in the general community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems that linguistics.SE was aimed at the general audience, and thus cannot have a policy of closing non-research questions.

It can be frustrating to see questions that are easily googlable, or that seem to ask for others to synthesize a complex theory/reference – which can be an undertaking even for a professional well-versed in the field.  (It is not for nothing that professors complain that teaching takes time away from their research.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, I remember what it was like for me only a few years ago, and it turns out I benefited a lot from people explaining things to me slowly, clearly, and repeatedly. I think the value of this site will be in making linguistics knowledge accessible to a wider range of people. As a professional, I have conferences and journals available as avenues of communication, as well as a reputation that makes many people willing to help me out.  But non-professionals, in the main, can't just email a professor or graduate student and ask a question – they would run the risk of being ignored.  Often they don't have access to classes in linguistics, or even journal subscriptions through a university library.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I try to structure my answers to questions so as to build bridges to theoretical linguistics.  It's a risky strategy – it may not be what the asker is looking for.  But the idea that I am helping amateur linguists gain better access to the knowledge I have gained through my education is my motivation for posting here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the LaTeX SX website (another where I have been somewhat active), many people post questions with too little information about their configuration to really diagnose their problem.  The community there has developed a list of responses along the lines of &quot;please edit your question to provide information X.&quot;  (I think they even have a meta question listing standard wording for these messages.)  I would be in favor of us developing something similar here, so that if someone asks a question that seems very basic, we respond with &quot;what resources have you tried consulting, what does Wikipedia say?&quot; etc.  This may take time to solidify – at present there is a lot of enthusiasm among core community members (on both the question and answer sides of the fence); as this wanes we will see what long-term willingness there is to endure certain types of questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For now, though, I think we should have a light hand in closing questions that are not &quot;research-level&quot; (though we can and should be strict about non-linguistic questions), and focus on creating awareness of appropriate reference sources for in questions that seem very basic (the WALS gets cited often in answers, for example).  We can also start building a tag structure (around [tag:theoretical-linguistics], perhaps) that accumulates questions of interest to high-level scholars." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Given the vastness of the Internet, it is madness to attempt to define ourselves relationally with respect to it.  Even within the SX microcosm, that isn't how things should work.  For a community to form, there needs to be something internal that makes it cohere; we can't just be the residue that other language-related SX sites don't soak up.  (This is the same reason why we ought to accept linguistically informed questions about English, even though there is an English Language SX.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This site is about theoretical lingusitics.  A question about the etymology of one word in one language is not within our scope since it has no way of linking up to a broader theory.

If yes, then on topic.  (Note: I don't think a no answer means off topic _at all_, this heuristic only works one way.)  By this measure practically everything in psychology of language comes in to some degree.  For instance, tip of the tongue phenomena is regularly taught in psycholinguistics classes (in ling departments).  When I was an undergrad there was a course in the linguistics department that even focused on speech errors and related issues such as TOT, though this kind of course is less widespread.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can come up with similar heuristics involving what is being researched in linguistics departments, too, as @Hauser suggests above in a comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many answers and comments here seem to be trying to take a more theory-based approach -- does the question have bearing on linguistic theory?  This is a reasonable question to ask in all of these cases, but I don't think it is useful as a way of deciding what is appropriate for this site.  Someone above (actually it is @Hauser too), for instance, suggests that results of TOT research don't have bearing on linguistics (which I take to mean, linguistic theory).  Whether this is right and why is an _extremely_ hard question to resolve for cases like this and by no means has an obvious or settled answer, I suspect if you ask 10 psycholinguists you will get 10 different answers.  It is bound up in the issue of whether you can study the grammar without studying its implementation (cf. competence vs. performance).  Seeing what practicing linguists actually do, rather than what is true (which in many cases we [linguists] don't know and may not for years if ever), seems much more practical to me."

Simply mentioning the word *psycholinguistic* (as in, &quot;Is psycholinguistic research done on this topic?&quot;) didn't make it an incontrovertibly on-topic question because so much of the rest of the question was concerned with reading and how our eyes and brains process printed words with spaces between them. Usually if you ask a linguist about language perception, she will assume you are talking about *aural* perception (unless you are talking about sign language). By wording the main question the way you did, linking *printed* words and sentences (not the central concern of linguists) to *pictures* (also not the central concern of linguists), you all but bypassed the facet of this reading phenomenon that is relevant for linguistic research! (By the way, morphemes are not printed entities, although some orthographies use units that correspond to morphemes. English orthography is not one of them.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm still new to this site myself, so I'd be interested to hear feedback from people in the form of comments, but it seems to me that rather than getting flagged as off-topic the reading question could be salvaged by being reworded. For example, a linguist might ask, &quot;What role do morpheme boundaries play in the phenomenon described above?&quot; or &quot;How language-dependent is this phenomenon? Do languages whose orthographies demarcate word boundaries with spaces fare better than other languages in this regard?&quot; or &quot;Has any typological research been done on this phenomenon? Is there a correlation between ease of reading scrambled words and where on the synthetic-isolating scale a language falls?&quot; The two answers provided (to date) for the question as it was originally worded actually speak more directly to these other versions of the question, bringing it more into the realm of linguistics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The problem is that it invites opinion (or speculation) over personal experience; other than that I don't think it breaks any of the guidelines.  One suggestion I made in the original thread: Solicit personal experiences on what works and what doesn't in running linguistic discussions for laypeople.  (Perhaps nobody will have personal experiences about running a linguistics *book club,* but I'm guessing some of us will have experience with running popular linguistic discussions more generally.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second: I suggested in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/186/bad-statistics-what-can-we-do&quot;&gt;bad stats thread&lt;/a&gt; that we should aim to help people with practical goals if we want to strengthen the user community here.  This strikes me as a good example of that: someone has a practical goal that's related to linguistics, they have a question about how to achieve that goal, and we are in a position to give answers.  Good answers will be linguistics-related.  (It would be fine to exclude non-linguistics-related answers like &quot;Put up an ad on Craigslist!&quot; or &quot;Make sure to serve snacks!&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, I think it is very much in our best interest to find some way of refining or redirecting questions like these rather than simply downvoting and closing.  We want to be a useful resource, and here's a way in which we can be useful (and enlarge our userbase) without breaking any SE guidelines or diluting the purpose of the site."

So much of theoretical linguistic research involves formulating hypotheses or building models based on data from a single language or a cluster of languages and then turning to analogous data in other languages to see if the original hypothesis is supported cross-linguistically or to lend credibility to the model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have yet to post a question on this site, but **this is precisely the type of question that I am most likely to bring to a forum like Linguistics SE**, because it is the most difficult kind of research to do systematically using other more traditional methods (i.e. it's hard to know where to look for something when your question is precisely of the form &quot;Where would I find *X*&quot;!). This site provides a unique way to harness the power of an engaged community with a common interest but an incredibly diverse palette of linguistic knowledge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me that one of the most powerful aspects of SE system is the flexibility built into it, which allows a **unique culture** to develop organically for each specific SE site in a way that makes sense for that field. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine a situation in which I'm trolling recent questions to see if there are any that I might be able to answer, and I come across one of the form &quot;Are there any languages with feature X&quot; or &quot;I'm looking for a bunch of languages with feature X&quot;, and someone has provided a perfectly acceptable answer with, say, a list of examples from three different languages. If I happen to know two more languages with the relevant feature, I'm not going to pass over the question because my list would be shorter and therefore somehow inferior. And I'm also not going to repeat the original three languages in my own answer alongside the additional two in an attempt to create a more comprehensive super-list of five languages! I'm simply going to add my answer with the two languages that I have, trusting that **this is a &quot;the more the merrier&quot; type of situation**. This was precisely what I did in [this situation][1], where the two people who had responded before me had provided perfectly acceptable answers but I happened to think of a couple of additional examples that I thought were worth sharing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for how to handle upvoting, one sensible way to approach upvoting on answers to &quot;list&quot; questions is simply to **upvote every answer that fulfills the criteria sought out in the question**. It wouldn't be a matter of picking the *best* answer but rather acknowledging *every accurate* answer, thereby rewarding each person who responded with helpful information for making a valuable contribution. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Incidentally, I believe this may currently be disallowed, but I think it would be great if whoever asked the original question could accept more than one answer as &quot;the correct answer&quot; (this may actually be a topic worthy of its own question here in Meta!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/653/is-there-any-language-that-observe-root-changes-in-response-to-the-addition-of-a/723#723" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Check the &quot;[Good subjective, bad subjective][2]&quot; thread posted by Cartaino.&#xD;&#xA; 2. **It was off topic**: Linguistics Stack Exchange has not a specified scope yet. But certainly we can't answer about why someone decided to change the entry on a dictionary and especially how this would affect future generations. (Again, asking for opinions.)&#xD;&#xA; 3. **It was badly formatted**: It was written as a letter, which means it wasn't a question. The body of the question is what tells us the &quot;situation&quot; for the question, (e.g. where the OP got that doubt from?) and helps us to understand what the OP is looking for. &#xD;&#xA; 4. **It was asking too many things**: Now, a question with 2 or 3 related questions to the main one might be ok, but here there were too many issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Too many points (I'm not sure I forgot something) which inevitably make it hard to edit the question in order to save it, unless we totally rephrase it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question even if closed, can still be edited and reopened.

What should our FAQ specifically contain?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The guidelines we've decided until now are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The **Linguistics Stack Exchange** is for linguists, language enthusiasts and people who have some interest in how languages work: about their birth, their development and sometimes about their death. It's also about how they interact with each other and how they are used by people. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions about these topics are welcome and also the ones listed in the bullet list below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, if you have questions about a single language, this might not be your place. For example, if you have a question about English language and its usage, consider posting on the [English StackExchange](http://english.stackexchange.com/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **What kind of questions can I ask here?**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  1. Questions about any language from a linguistics point of view; &#xD;&#xA; 2. Linguistics phenomena during history;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Questions about the Linguistics subcategories (Phonetics, Phonology, Pragmatics, Semantics, etc.);&#xD;&#xA; 4. Questions about currents, theories, and their applications in actual languages;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Questions about a single word in relation to multiple languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **What kind of questions should I *not* ask here?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  1. Questions that are not about Linguistics and their subcategories;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Translation-request questions;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Questions about a single word for a single language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Therefore, not only experts but also people interested in the matter, students, researchers, anyone **regardless** of your knowledge in the matter. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What is Linguistics about?** Linguistics is about languages from a &quot;total&quot; point of view. It is about their birth, their development and sometimes (unfortunately) about their death. It's also about how they interact with each other and how they are used by people, how they work, etc… As you might guess, this is just a quick and not precise description, Linguistics is much more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions about these subjects are on topic. If you still have doubts, keep on reading, you can find more info below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note**: if you have questions about a single language, this might not be your place. For example, if you have a question about English language and its usage, consider posting on the English StackExchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### What kind of questions can I ask here?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Questions about any language from a linguistics point of view.**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If you ask about the etymology of a single word, it wouldn't be accepted as there are better sources for this kind of question, such as dictionaries or the StackExchange sites for those languages. However, there is a fine line, so if you're in doubt ask either in Chat or Meta.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;2. **Linguistics phenomena during history.**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. **Questions about the Linguistics subcategories.**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; The subcategories and their definition can be found in the graph below: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; *Semantics, Morphology, Phonology, Phonetics, Syntax, Pragmatics, …* (graph will go here, did I forget some subcategory?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; There are other categories that are not &quot;pure&quot;, i.e. they are disciplines that share both Linguistics and other disciplines, such as *Psycholinguistics, Sociolinguistics, Neurolinguistics, Language education, Language development, Language acquisition, Evolutionary linguistics, Computational linguistics, …* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. **Questions about currents, theories, and their applications in actual languages.**&#xD;&#xA;5. **Questions about a single word in relation to multiple languages.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### What kind of questions should I *not* ask here?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Questions that are not about Linguistics and their subcategories.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; (examples?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. **Translation-request questions.**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Asking translations of any kind is off topic on this site. Language-related SE sites usually put this matter off topic if it's a simple question like &quot;Translate this for me&quot;, i.e. providing context and personal efforts can turn that question acceptable. But this site is not meant for any particular language and Linguistics doesn't treat about translation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Still, if your question is about the linguistics reasons for some translations in different languages, etc., then it can be accepted. It will be necessary to check each question, since it's not reasonably possible to treat each case here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. **Questions about a single word for a single language.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; We have agreed to consider such questions as off topic. For example, asking the etymology of *one* word in *one language*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; However asking for a single word for multiple languages, considering the &quot;Linguistics&quot; element, would be acceptable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Other FAQ**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **There are many &quot;howevers&quot;!** — Well, the fact is that the form counts a lot.

(Although this could admin Volapuk and Klingon which each had/have a single native speaker)  The non-natural languages are partially in the realm of art.  When these questions do pop up, they should be referred to writers SE, sci-fi SE or the conlang SE proposal. On writers and sci-fi, about a half dozen conlang questions have been asked, answered and haven't been closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is actually a difficult rule to write because there is a lot of grey area.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**UPDATE:** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suggested Text:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Natural languages with native speakers are on topic. Fictional, constructed and auxiliary languages without native speakers are off topic. This should not discourage anyone from asking about language formalisms, such as context free grammars. Consider asking questions about fictional languages on Writers SE, Science-Fiction Fantasy SE or the Conlang SE proposal.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would pretty much rules out Lojban, Na'vi, Elvish, Shyriiwook, toki pona, Laadan, languages invented by a single person as a hobby, New Speak, almost all auxiliary language proposals except Esperanto.  There are single reports of native speakers of Volapuk, Klingon and a handful of cases of native speakers of previously dead languages-- Latin, Sanskrit. Other than that, the rule at least would have little grey area.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know about non-recreational medical conlangs, like Bliss Symbols or those communication systems invented for the deal and blind or otherwise disabled, which can have the characteristics of a constructed language (i.e. go beyond being an encoding of English).

Therefore, not only experts but also people interested in the matter, students, researchers, anyone **regardless** of your knowledge in the matter. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What is Linguistics about?** Linguistics is about languages from a &quot;total&quot; — i.e. broad, wide — point of view. It is about their birth, their development and sometimes (unfortunately) about their death. It's also about how they interact with each other and how they are used by people, how they work, etc… As you might guess, this is just a quick and not precise description, Linguistics is much more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions about these subjects are on topic. If you still have doubts, keep on reading, you can find more info below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note**: if you have questions about a single language, this might not be your place. For example, if you have a question about English language and its usage, consider posting on the English StackExchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### What kind of questions can I ask here?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Questions about any language from a linguistics point of view.** If you ask about the etymology of a single word, it wouldn't be accepted as there are better sources for this kind of question, such as dictionaries or the StackExchange sites for those languages. However, there is a fine line, so if you're in doubt ask either in Chat or Meta.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;2. **Linguistics phenomena during history.**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. **Questions about the Linguistics subcategories.** The subcategories and their definition can be found in the graph below: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; *Semantics, Morphology, Phonology, Phonetics, Syntax, Pragmatics, …* (graph will go here, did I forget some subcategory?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; There are other categories that are not &quot;pure&quot;, i.e. they are disciplines that share both Linguistics and other disciplines, such as *Psycholinguistics, Sociolinguistics, Neurolinguistics, Language education, Language development, Language acquisition, the Evolution of language, Computational linguistics, …* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. **Questions about currents, theories, and their applications in actual languages.**&#xD;&#xA;5. **Questions about a single word in relation to multiple languages.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### What kind of questions should I *not* ask here?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Questions that are not about Linguistics and their subcategories.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; (examples?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. **Translation-request questions.** Asking translations of any kind is off topic on this site.

Having already gone through the process of learning a few languages fairly satisfactorily (for my own purposes), I can usually just pick up a grammar book and start assimilation. I guess a lot of linguists are probably in this situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The book needs to have certain features, though. So, content being, a language, a certain approach seen in other grammars, may I ask such a question?&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;I have heard that questions which lead to lists of answers are not on topic, but this is no such question. At most, it could have one valid answer, as I only plan to study one text. &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Specifically, I'm looking for an ancient greek grammar that has certain features:&#xD;&#xA;1) heavy focus on actual texts 2) some attempts at reconstructing pronounciation 3) broken down into short chapters 4) fairly complete treatment (self-contained, not introductory)&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;It's single-language, but where else to ask it?"

The study of Ancient Greek also often falls under historical/classical studies, as many universities combine it with these sorts of courses, so people in these fields would probably also have good recommendations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A grammar for teaching/learning a language can be quite a different thing to the types of linguistic descriptions of a language that are also called grammars. For anyone who has ever looked at most of the books on English grammar, it is clear that these sorts of books are sometimes not informed by a *linguistic* analysis of a language's grammar (and, in the case of English at least, many of these sorts of books include things that are completely at odds with current linguistic description and instead based on arbitrary preferences of the author). While I doubt that such a separation is true for Ancient Greek, my point is that linguists are more likely to be familiar with grammatical materials that are *not* designed for language teaching/learning (except through their personal interest in such a thing, but this site is about professional rather than personal insights).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the question were something more like &quot;Is there a comprehensive grammatical description of Language A that covers features such as X, Y and Z that I can use for a typological comparison with Language B?&quot;, I would consider the question on-topic, because it clearly seeks a linguistically-informed description for the purposes of linguistic research (and some old grammars of languages can certainly be difficult to track down or find any records of).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are lots of other places you can ask for a recommendation for materials to help you learn Ancient Greek, and which fit your criteria (places where people may be able to help you better anyway, if the shared interest is more about materials that are useful for teaching/learning rather than linguistic analysis). You could try contacting the people at [this blog about (Ancient) Greek language and linguistics][1], which also has a page about Greek grammars. Ancient Greek is still a reasonably widely-studied language, so a Google search also gives you a lot of different forums and reference pages, and Amazon etc. overviews can often give you a good idea of the contents of any books.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://greek-language.com/grklinguist/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This can help give some nice boost to the site and spice up the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Wait a moment... Isn't such an increase going to bring bad and poor questions?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Nope and the reason is simple. The challenge week brings questions because there is a prize for the winner, so this makes it so that people just don't ask *anything*, but make sure to ask good questions in order to make other users like their questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Prize? What prize?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; There isn't a pre-decided prize, but only a pre-decided *&quot;price&quot;*.

So, deciding the winner based on page views is the best option, in my opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the topic, there are some possibilities, based on what I've seen in other sites:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A scholar's week, much like the [Philosopher's week][1]. We could have, for example, Chomsky's week, Saussure's week, etc.&#xD;&#xA; - A game challenge, similar to the [treasure hunt][2], proposed on Travel.SE. I don't know if this kind of challenge would work on a science site like Linguistics.SE, but maybe someone out there has some clever idea (I'd really like to hear about that).&#xD;&#xA; - A challenge based on some linguistics subfield.

This can help give some nice boost to the site and spice up the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Wait a moment... Isn't such an increase going to bring bad and poor questions?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Nope and the reason is simple. The challenge week brings questions because there is a prize for the winner, so this makes it so that people just don't ask *anything*, but make sure to ask good questions in order to make other users like their questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; That depends on the type of &quot;selection&quot; we decide, but we will make it so that users are prompted to post good questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Prize? What prize?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; There isn't a pre-decided prize, but only a pre-decided *&quot;price&quot;*. Well actually the prize is decided, meaning that it will be a book, but for a maximum of a certain budget, usually $50.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **How do we decide who's the winner?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; I asked Lauren and there are some ways, you may propose your view in your answer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - You get more entries based on the number of questions you ask rather than the number of up votes you get, so there is no danger of sock puppet voting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - Upvotes: but there is the danger of sock puppet voting.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; &gt; - Views: This would prompt posters to share their questions = more traffic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - A mixture of some of the above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. **Ok, I'm in. What's the topic? And when do we do this?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; I was thinking of doing **one** challenge week per month, as a maximum. Say, the first week of each month, and we could start next February. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Regarding the topic, well, I don't know yet. We can start by seeing what are your impressions, opinions, ideas...

There's two primary reasons for this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The message gets presented on *every* page of the site, to *every user* of the site for the duration of the display. That's annoying and unwelcome, and our users have [repeatedly](http://meta.serverfault.com/questions/807/is-the-dark-blue-system-notification-bar-annoying) [requested](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/64118/allow-us-an-exit-hatch-to-dismiss-the-system-message-notification-bar) [limitations](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/108574/can-we-make-memorial-banners-clickable-to-dismiss) [on their use](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/114020/please-do-not-use-stack-overflow-to-promote-social-causes). &#xD;&#xA; - Second, and perhaps more important, overuse of the system message leads to **blindness to messages when the message is *super* important**. A good metaphor: if I were to write this post 90% bold and 10% unboldened text, would you be able to actually determine what parts of the post were important? If you highlight in a textbook and 90% of the page is yellow from the marker, have you actually denoted main ideas and important concepts? The them idea is here; overuse of the system message turns it into Just Another Part of the Site. And we need system message banners to *remain unique*. Generally speaking, we only put them up for things like the site being down for maintenance, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We understand that you're wanting to raise the profile of these contests, but system messages *can't* be the way you do that. We're [working on a solution](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/115821/165582) but there's not a concrete timeline for it yet. Still, the current method isn't sustainable. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I am deeply sympathetic to how frustrating this is. I wish I had a magical perfect solution for you -- but I don't.

I also think that the other question (Is it common to use the minor third for calling someone? ) is different. The latter question is more about the prevalence of the feature, while the closed question is about whether Italian has it. CMIIW, a good linguist probably is expected to know about linguistics features, their prevalence and distribution, but he's not expected to be able to know exactly which languages have and do not have it it. In my opinion, this is what make them different. Maybe we tend to think that the closed question is interesting because it is talking about a major European language (&lt;s&gt;not to mention @Alenanno's mother tongue,&lt;/s&gt; just kidding) and it is an interesting feature. Consider: Does Amharic have the sound /ʃ/? Is it common to use the passive voice in Bengali? I think these questions would be clearly off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Speaking of consistency, I think it's more reason to close this one. If we let this one, we will have to be consistent and let other &quot;Does Language X have feature Y&quot; questions. Before we know it, people will be asking about single features of some obscure languages, potentially reducing the appeal of this website to people who have serious interest in linguistics and not just features of individual languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is just my opinion, though, if the popular opinion disagree, we can always reopen the question."

(Consider the question: is it &quot;common&quot; to say &quot;Every boy_i likes their_i mother&quot; instead of &quot;Every boy_i likes his_i mother&quot; (the latter of which sounds atrocious to me)---where such a question may act as a simple proxy/probe for acceptability within a certain dialect grouping.) With regards to &quot;Does language X have feature Y&quot; or &quot;Does any language have feature Y&quot; questions, these seem often to be interesting _in particular_ if not obviously _in general_, but why go out of your way to close them? A lot of linguists specialize in different languages or language families, and simply glory (like the best nerds) in applying their knowledge to as particular or as general of circumstances you like. I think the only time questions should be closed is when they are OBVIOUSLY off-topic, not when they simply seem &quot;marginal&quot; to the concerns of whatever individual happens to be pressing the on/off topic button.

If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why do we close a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask][1] section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions belong elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is closing like deletion?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What are the requirements for closing a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have 500 reputation on the site currently, or 3000 reputation on a graduated site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How are moderators different?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Initially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ok, so how does it work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Example close button][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close vote reasons dialog][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Other votes][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&#xD;&#xA; * The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.&#xD;&#xA; * The other options are straight out closes.&#xD;&#xA; * Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&#xD;&#xA; * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&#xD;&#xA; * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close banner][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How does vote to re-open work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Re-open link][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What happens if I make a mistake?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually there are two tools for this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * [Review][7]. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes. You are then free to look at the question and decide if you agree.&#xD;&#xA; * [Tools][8]. Commonly referred to as the &quot;10k tools&quot;, this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page. Here, you can see questions that might have been closed incorrectly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/review&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/tools" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Take the &quot;false friends&quot; for example. They're interesting for us, so why wouldn't a *whole sentence* that works as a false friend be interesting as well? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; In other situations, the question would have been prompting for list questions, and this one is as well, but given the fact that such sentences are very rare, it might only prompt a few answers which is ok in terms of Q&amp;A requirements. As a proof for this, only one answer in that question actually provides a sentence. The others just words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Question**: The question has received downvotes and upvotes, while the answers only the latter. I could think that this is due to the fact that the question is not the best one I've seen in terms of wording and detail/context. Not to mention that the OP basically disappeared and we received no answers at all to our requests for clarifications. Maybe this is why it's getting downvotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to what comes out from this Meta question and also from what comes out between me and the other mods, I'm going to either save or close the question, but you (and everyone) must know that I'm tending to decide for **closing it**. Not for the topic, which is very interesting and stimulating, but for the fact that the OP didn't answer and we can't certainly edit the question without being aware of his/her real original intention. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think I addressed all of the points, but if there is something I missed, let me know."

I think open but not very many upvotes is the expected fate for this kind of question. It's just a middling question in my opinion; not bad enough to close since it really is a linguistically interesting exercise, but not good enough to upvote very many times times either. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said - this is the kind of middling question that could lead to a great answer, and JPP's answer was pretty nice."

The question was actually good (the subject) but it was vague and not so well-asked, besides the OP showed really no interest on improving it. (If the OP comes back and improves it, I can reopen it, assuming it will fit SE's and our standards.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks for asking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think we need to separate two things here: first, the subject of the question and second, the question itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **Subject/Topic**: I think most would agree but I'd like everybody to confirm or not that the topic of the question is actually *very* interesting for those who have studied Linguistics. Take the &quot;false friends&quot; for example. They're interesting for us, so why wouldn't a *whole sentence* that works as a false friend be interesting as well? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; In other situations, the question would have been prompting for list questions, and this one is as well, but given the fact that such sentences are very rare, it might only prompt a few answers which is ok in terms of Q&amp;A requirements. As a proof for this, only one answer in that question actually provides a sentence. The others just words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Question**: The question has received downvotes and upvotes, while the answers only the latter. I could think that this is due to the fact that the question is not the best one I've seen in terms of wording and detail/context. Not to mention that the OP basically disappeared and we received no answers at all to our requests for clarifications. Maybe this is why it's getting downvotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to what comes out from this Meta question and also from what comes out between me and the other mods, I'm going to either save or close the question, but you (and everyone) must know that I'm tending to decide for **closing it**. Not for the topic, which is very interesting and stimulating, but for the fact that the OP didn't answer and we can't certainly edit the question without being aware of his/her real original intention. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think I addressed all of the points, but if there is something I missed, let me know."

Tags are only placed on questions for this reason - a tag is meant to identify what the *question* is about. The main reason a question may get an answer that introduces a new technology or concept is because the question author may not have known of its existence, its name, or that it was effective for the desired purposes. As such, users who would have the same question or are in the same boat would not look for that term, because they don't know what the solution is. That's why they're searching in the first place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the question truly *is* about the technology or concept that is mentioned in the answers, and the author just didn't know the term (and this not-knowing part is not a core part of the original question, to boot), then it would make sense not just to update the tags, but the question as a whole. This makes the question then helpful to those who do know the matter, as it is a part of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**&quot;Is it part of the question or the solution?&quot;** This is what you should ask yourself if an answer introduces an element that you think could add a new tag. If the question is actually about that element, just not explicitly stated, then you could add it. But if the question is merely *solved* by that new element, that doesn't make it a question about said element.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The findability of the answer is dependent on the question it is linked. If an answer of pragmatics is something that should be found because it is a solution related to pragmatics, then the question should reflect this.

NOTE**: Information may vary until the start of the Challenge. So keep checking!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Premise**: This Meta question will be the one we will use for this Challenge Week but also for the future ones. The title will change after the hyphen, showing the Challenge's number (in order of time) and the topic for the current week, or for the upcoming one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If you want to read about the previous weeks, check the **[Challenge Wiki Database][1]**.&#xD;&#xA;- If you want to propose a topic, then check **[the appropriate meta discussion][2]**!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The Challenge Week will start next week.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We will use this topic to advertise it, and in the meantime we decide who gets selected. Basically we decide some requirements, if during the week you fulfil these requirements, you'll get included in a draw that will decide the winner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Information&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **What's the topic?**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Syntax&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **When will it be?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; 27 February 00.00 UTC - 4 March 23.59 UTC, 2012  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; (**Note**: only questions in such dates will be considered.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **How do I participate?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; You must ask questions about [Syntax][3] and tag them [tag:syntax] (If you start writing it or if you write something that belongs to the tag name spelling, the system will propose it to you). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; *Usual rules apply*: use the appropriate tags, no polls, no list questions, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **How do I get selected?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The parameter we have thought is the **Page views**! The minimum limit is **100**. The better the question, the easier it is to gain attention, but there are ways to improve this! How? **Sharing!** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The easiest way is using the buttons on the left, after the question has been asked: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; ![enter image description here][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Alternatively, you can just share the question address wherever you want it to be seen... and clicked. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. **How is the winner selected?**&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; &gt; When the week ends and we get — *for example* — 6 candidates, we pass their names to the CHAOS/SE team, and they will take a draw. After that the winner is selected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. **Wait, a draw? So it's random?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Well... Yes. But your work is still important! Basically (data by the end of the Challenge):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - 1 Question with 100 views is 1 lot in the draw.&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - Every +100 is a +1 lot in the draw, so 300 views = 3 lots&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - Every additional question with 100 views is 1 lot. So 3 questions with 100 views each = 3 lots.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Therefore, the **more questions you ask** and the **more you share** ➝ the **more chances you'll have to win**!&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 7. **What do I win?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The **GLORY** of being among the first winners of the Linguistics SE Challenge Week series! :P&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/251/111&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/230/111&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/231/111&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NgESU.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There is a question body so you can elaborate on the &quot;title/question&quot; in order to be more specific and clear about what you're asking.

This means use capitals letters and punctuation when it's required, also use the blockquotes for quotes and not the code-field, which exists to write code.

Five small paragraphs are more readable than a huge single one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Avoid writing links like &quot;this&quot; or &quot;here&quot;**. This is not a strict rule, but it gives people the chance to know what they are going to visit, or if it's a site/pdf/image. For example  you might choose a wording where the text-link is the title of the document you're linking; it's also useful if you specify when it's an image, for those who have slow connections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If possible, include a reference**. StackExchange sites are about definite, objective answers and not about opinions, (that's why we have the &quot;subjective question&quot; close-vote), so providing reference, you're assuring the OP and the readers that what you say is true and backed up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Avoid one-line answers**. It might be correct, but an answer made by a single sentence is not that informative. A bit of elaboration is very useful for the reader and for the visitors. Don't worry about being &quot;long&quot;: every information you think that can be useful for the others to know will always be accepted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Be kind to other users**. If you're writing a question, remember that you're asking to be helped, so make sure to show your appreciation to the ones who answer by being kind. If you're answering, instead, don't attack the OP and don't be aggressive. It won't bring any good to the site.

There is a question body so you can elaborate on the &quot;title/question&quot; in order to be more specific and clear about what you're asking. Providing info, not only reduces the risk of down-voting or close-voting, but it also improves the chances of having a proper answer. *The better the question, the better the answers!*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Write appropriately and use the correct formatting**. This means use capitals letters and punctuation when it's required, also use the blockquotes for quotes and not the code-field, which exists to write code. Avoid slang or colloquial expressions as much as possible. A well-written question/answer is one of the steps of attracting better answers or upvotes too. Also, avoid writing a huge single paragraph. Five small paragraphs are more readable than a huge single one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Avoid writing links like &quot;this&quot; or &quot;here&quot;**. This is not a strict rule, but it gives people the chance to know what they are going to visit, or if it's a site/pdf/image. For example  you might choose a wording where the text-link is the title of the document you're linking; it's also useful if you specify when it's an image, for those who have slow connections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If possible, include a reference**. StackExchange sites are about definite, objective answers and not about opinions, (that's why we have the &quot;subjective question&quot; close-vote), so providing reference, you're assuring the OP and the readers that what you say is true and backed up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Avoid one-line answers**. It might be correct, but an answer made by a single sentence is not that informative. A bit of elaboration is very useful for the reader and for the visitors. Don't worry about being &quot;long&quot;: every information you think that can be useful for the others to know will always be accepted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Be kind to other users**. If you're writing a question, remember that you're asking to be helped, so make sure to show your appreciation to the ones who answer by being kind. If you're answering, instead, don't attack the OP and don't be aggressive; this doesn't mean you can't question/challenge other answers or the question. The point is that being tactful would help to face the discussion in a smoother and better way. It won't bring any good to the site to just attack other people, especially being personal. Like they say *&quot;treat others as you wish to be treated&quot;*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Citations**. When you cite a paper/article, don't just post a raw link. Please provide the title and the author(s). For example: *&quot;Title&quot;* by [author]. You get the idea. Providing citation is also useful in case the subject is not widely known. But we encourage citations regardless of the subject being famous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So 3 questions with 50 views each = 3 lots.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Therefore, the **more questions you ask** and the **more you share** ➝ the **more chances you'll have to win**!&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 7. **What do I win?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The **GLORY** of being among the first winners of the Linguistics SE Challenge Week series! :P&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Good luck!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/251/111&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/230/111&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/231/111&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NgESU.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

It's not asking merely for a list of resources, but specifically as a list of what resources interest you, the community of this site. Whether or not the accumulation of a set of resources is acceptable on the site, it is important that it should be framed in a way that is not a poll or survey. Otherwise it gives the impression that polling and surveying the interests of users here is an appropriate form of question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some background reading on my recommendations for handling resource repositories in general can be reviewed [in this answer from UX](http://meta.ux.stackexchange.com/questions/768/should-we-allow-community-wiki-type-lists-posts-on-the-main-site/783#783). Note that my comments on Community Wiki specifically are about using it as an *excuse for acceptability*. If you are leveraging the lowered-edit-barrier on an answer, that's fine and also has nothing to do with acceptability. Also it has no need for community wiki to be applied on the question itself. Focus less on that point, more on the parts about framing and expectations of a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm generally opposed to these &quot;repository&quot; style questions because they never quite do what they must properly do. The more maintenance that is required for a repository, the less tends to get done in order to keep it in top shape. To quote from my UX answer,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The solution to a list question is a complete list of all the items that could possibly apply to the author's needs in an expert manner. This is something that has never really been successfully accomplished with how these list questions play out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unlike the UX example which is a lot more broadly approached (as it is about repositories in general), this example is specifically targeted at the problem of &quot;Getting Started in Linguistics&quot;. That is a topic which has the potential to be a powerful resource on this site, if properly maintained and constructed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd still prefer that this be done in a fashion *other* than listing reading material on the subject matter. Focus more on the overall concerns of getting started, not just on books. There's no reason that book recommendations can't be a *part* of this process, but making it the goal of the question just tends to open up a lot more problems than it solves.

There is a question body so you can elaborate on the &quot;title/question&quot; in order to be more specific and clear about what you're asking. Providing info, not only reduces the risk of down-voting or close-voting, but it also improves the chances of having a proper answer. *The better the question, the better the answers!*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Write appropriately and use the correct formatting**. This means use capitals letters and punctuation when it's required, also use the blockquotes for quotes and not the code-field, which exists to write code. Avoid slang or colloquial expressions as much as possible. A well-written question/answer is one of the steps of attracting better answers or upvotes too. Also, avoid writing a huge single paragraph. Five small paragraphs are more readable than a huge single one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Avoid writing links like &quot;this&quot; or &quot;here&quot;**. This is not a strict rule, but it gives people the chance to know what they are going to visit, or if it's a site/pdf/image. For example  you might choose a wording where the text-link is the title of the document you're linking; it's also useful if you specify when it's an image, for those who have slow connections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If possible, include a reference**. StackExchange sites are about definite, objective answers and not about opinions, (that's why we have the &quot;subjective question&quot; close-vote), so providing reference, you're assuring the OP and the readers that what you say is true and backed up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Avoid one-line answers**. It might be correct, but an answer made by a single sentence is not that informative. A bit of elaboration is very useful for the reader and for the visitors. Don't worry about being &quot;long&quot;: every information you think that can be useful for the others to know will always be accepted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Be kind to other users**. If you're writing a question, remember that you're asking to be helped, so make sure to show your appreciation to the ones who answer by being kind. If you're answering, instead, don't attack the OP and don't be aggressive; this doesn't mean you can't question/challenge other answers or the question. The point is that being tactful would help to face the discussion in a smoother and better way. It won't bring any good to the site to just attack other people, especially being personal. Like they say *&quot;treat others as you wish to be treated&quot;*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Citations**. When you cite a paper/article, don't just post a raw link. Please provide the title and the author(s). For example: *&quot;Title&quot;* by [author]. You get the idea. Providing citation is also useful in case the subject is not widely known. But we encourage citations regardless of the subject being famous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

My thoughts are that in our case, unlike StackOverflow, questions about homeworks are different, they are kind of &quot;harder&quot;. By this I mean that assignments in Linguistics are harder to understand because although Languages are quite definite systems (despite the general thinking), they are not as definite as code questions. So, it's not like asking for 1+1=2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The user also just joined us. As you can see this is not only the OP's first question in Linguistics but also the user's first question across all the SE sites: he doesn't have the +100 given to you when you join second sites. Unless he decided not to associate accounts, of course. But given that he was new at least in our site, I think we could go easy on new users. Not only because they are just starting to understand how SE sites work (which are harder than regular forums), but also because if we just start scolding people and down-voting their questions, they will be scared away and we would lose a potential good user just for a single question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I'm glad to see that other users care about the rules and not just the &quot;evil Mods&quot; :D I think that in some cases we can close an eye and help beginners to make their way. I'm not saying they're justified to do anything. But in telling them what they should or shouldn't do, we could use a different approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Regarding the matter in general**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd like to make it clear that my opinion is to keep homework questions and not ban them. Why ban a possible resource for more questions? They can still raise interesting points, and so I think we should keep them. That been said, I also think we need to set some minimum standards, to make sure we don't get &quot;gimme teh codez&quot; questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example: Ask the OP to show some &quot;tries&quot;. We don't care if they are totally wrong. We just want to see that the OP tried to do something so we can also help more effectively on the specific problems. And if it turns out that they didn't understand anything, then we could also explain the whole thing, but still encourage for **research effort**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know what other criteria we could use, but we can certainly discuss about this.

There is a question body so you can elaborate on the &quot;title/question&quot; in order to be more specific and clear about what you're asking. Providing info, not only reduces the risk of down-voting or close-voting, but it also improves the chances of having a proper answer. *The better the question, the better the answers!*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Write appropriately and use the correct formatting**. This means use capitals letters and punctuation when it's required, also use the blockquotes for quotes and not the code-field, which exists to write code. Avoid slang or colloquial expressions as much as possible. A well-written question/answer is one of the steps of attracting better answers or upvotes too. Also, avoid writing a huge single paragraph. Five small paragraphs are more readable than a huge single one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Avoid writing links like &quot;this&quot; or &quot;here&quot;**. This is not a strict rule, but it gives people the chance to know what they are going to visit, or if it's a site/pdf/image. For example  you might choose a wording where the text-link is the title of the document you're linking; it's also useful if you specify when it's an image, for those who have slow connections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If possible, include a reference**. StackExchange sites are about definite, objective answers and not about opinions, (that's why we have the &quot;subjective question&quot; close-vote), so providing reference, you're assuring the OP and the readers that what you say is true and backed up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Avoid one-line answers**. It might be correct, but an answer made by a single sentence is not that informative. A bit of elaboration is very useful for the reader and for the visitors. Don't worry about being &quot;long&quot;: every information you think that can be useful for the others to know will always be accepted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Be kind to other users**. If you're writing a question, remember that you're asking to be helped, so make sure to show your appreciation to the ones who answer by being kind. If you're answering, instead, don't attack the OP and don't be aggressive; this doesn't mean you can't question/challenge other answers or the question. The point is that being tactful would help to face the discussion in a smoother and better way. It won't bring any good to the site to just attack other people, especially being personal. Like they say *&quot;treat others as you wish to be treated&quot;*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Citations**. When you cite a paper/article, don't just post a raw link. Please provide the title and the author(s). For example: *&quot;Title&quot;* by [author]. You get the idea. Providing citation is also useful in case the subject is not widely known. But we encourage citations regardless of the subject being famous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Some of it falls outside of our topic range or standards, but a good number could be tuned up into great questions. I suggest we approach people who have asked good questions there, and ask them to either repost here or let us do it for them. We should offer them the opportunity first since (A) reddit is still by and large driven by the idea of &quot;internet points&quot; and (B) getting them to post it themselves is much more direct involvement. Otherwise though we post it under a special account.  (We could also just have a team of question harvesters that rotate; I'm just concerned some might cry foul at anyone reaping reputation off the process.)  Then we can go back to the original thread and let everyone know the discussion was ported.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We don't want to seem like &quot;competition&quot; of course, but I think as long as our purpose is clear that won't be a problem.

NOTE**: Information may vary until the start of the Challenge. So keep checking!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Challenge Weeks are currently on hold. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Premise**: This Meta question will be the one we will use for this Challenge Week but also for the future ones. The title will change after the hyphen, showing the Challenge's number (in order of time) and the topic for the current week, or for the upcoming one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If you want to read about the previous weeks, check the **[Challenge Wiki Database][1]**.&#xD;&#xA;- If you want to propose a topic, then check **[the appropriate meta discussion][2]**!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We will use this topic to advertise it, and in the meantime we decide who gets selected. Basically we decide some requirements, if during the week you fulfil these requirements, you'll get included in a draw that will decide the winner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **For this third challenge, I lowered the limit to 50 views, so it's easier to participate! Just share your question to increase that by thousands!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Information&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **What's the topic?**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Methodology&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **When will it be?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; 12 March 00.00 UTC - 18 March 23.59 UTC, 2012  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; (**Note**: only questions in such dates will be considered.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **How do I participate?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; You must ask questions about Methodology and tag them [tag:methodology] (If you start writing it or if you write something that belongs to the tag name spelling, the system will propose it to you). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; *Usual rules apply*: use the appropriate tags, no polls, no list questions, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **How do I get selected?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The parameter we have thought is the **Page views**! The minimum limit is **50**. The better the question, the easier it is to gain attention, but there are ways to improve this! How? **Sharing!** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The easiest way is using the buttons on the left, after the question has been asked: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; ![enter image description here][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Alternatively, you can just share the question address wherever you want it to be seen... and clicked. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. **How is the winner selected?**&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; &gt; When the week ends and we get — *for example* — 6 candidates, we pass their names to the CHAOS/SE team, and they will take a draw. After that the winner is selected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. **Wait, a draw? So it's random?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Well... Yes. But your work is still important! Basically (data by the end of the Challenge):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - 1 Question with 50 views is 1 lot in the draw.&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - Every +50 is a +1 lot in the draw, so 150 views = 3 lots&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - Every additional question with 50 views is 1 lot. So 3 questions with 50 views each = 3 lots.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Therefore, the **more questions you ask** and the **more you share** ➝ the **more chances you'll have to win**!&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 7. **What do I win?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The **GLORY** of being among the first winners of the Linguistics SE Challenge Week series! :P&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Good luck!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/251/111&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/230/111&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/231/111&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NgESU.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This way we'd help you regardless of the difficulty of the question. :) **(2)** The question is more focused on the Linguistics aspect rather than the Usage one, because in that case it'd get off topic. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Anyway, these are guidelines to help everyone provide a better service.

Clearly, there are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; steps beyond finding &quot;early adopters&quot;, but without addressing the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; approaches required to engage/convert &quot;early adopters&quot;, such steps are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; meaningless in my opinion; this based on my knowledge of how&#xD;&#xA;&gt; technology adoption life-cycles work, and more importantly in my&#xD;&#xA;&gt; opinion, how they are comparable to the adoption life-cycles of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; constructed languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;COMMENTS BEFORE META:&#xD;&#xA;---------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions about Constructed languages are considered off-topic on this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; site.

Clearly, there are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; steps beyond finding &quot;early adopters&quot;, but without addressing the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; approaches required to engage/convert &quot;early adopters&quot;, such steps are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; meaningless in my opinion; this based on my knowledge of how&#xD;&#xA;&gt; technology adoption life-cycles work, and more importantly in my&#xD;&#xA;&gt; opinion, how they are comparable to the adoption life-cycles of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; constructed languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;COMMENTS BEFORE META:&#xD;&#xA;---------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Questions about [Constructed languages are considered off-topic][2] on this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; site. I'll migrate this as soon as the Conlang proposal goes into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Beta. :) – **Alenanno♦**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Pointing to a list you created the same day&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that contains no explaination is the same as your comment above&#xD;&#xA;&gt; without a link; meaning the link adds no value, and is confusing. Why&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is the question off-topic? Thanks! – **blunders** &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - blunders, have you read the FAQ before? It was there until today. I&#xD;&#xA;&gt; just created a Meta question and moved it. But it existed before&#xD;&#xA;&gt; today. – **Alenanno♦** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - No, I never read the FAQs, and to my knowledge&#xD;&#xA;&gt; based on my analysis, neither do must users. That said, saying it was&#xD;&#xA;&gt; listed is still not an answer as to why these question are off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If it's because of the proposal, that's the wrong way to handle this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in my opinion; meaning the questions should be left open. – **blunders**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Well, if you don't read the FAQ, then you shouldn't be surprised if&#xD;&#xA;&gt; some questions get closed. Reading the FAQ is in your best interest,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; always, not just here. The reason is that Linguistics is about natural&#xD;&#xA;&gt; languages, and not that the proposal exists. The proposal exists for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that reason, I guess. – **Alenanno♦** &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Beyond you, who says that linguistics is only about natural languages?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; – **blunders**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - @blunders: The underlying reason is probably that this is not part of the academic field of linguistics. And why is that? Because&#xD;&#xA;&gt; linguistics is about the way language works as a natural phenomenon,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as perceived externally. So a constructed language is more about how&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an individual person would like to design an artistic project. That&#xD;&#xA;&gt; said, questions like why did Esperanto become more popular in x than&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in y? might be on topic, though perhaps they would be a better fit for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; History.SE. Questions about &quot;how do I find x&quot; are only on topic if&#xD;&#xA;&gt; they ask for resources about linguistics. – **Cerberus**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - @blunders [This][3] for example. If there is a constructed languages with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; native speakers, then we could think of allowing it. – **Alenanno♦**  &#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - @Cerberus: So, any linguistics courses on unnatural languages within a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; linguistic degree program would not be proof they are part of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; linguistics? – **blunders** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - @blunders If you don't agree with the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closure, which seems to be the case, consider opening a question in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Linguistics Meta so we don't clutter the comments. – **Alenanno♦** &#xD;&#xA; 	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - @Alenanno: You do realize the whole point of this question is to gain&#xD;&#xA;&gt; native speakers, right? – **blunders**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - @Alenanno: A question on meta&#xD;&#xA;&gt; about just this question would be to localized in my opinion. –&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **blunders** &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - @blunders No, that's perfectly acceptable and it's actually standard&#xD;&#xA;&gt; procedure. :) I'll be happy to answer there too, if you post it. –&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Alenanno♦** &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - @blunders: To me, it would not, because I really don't think this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; should be a subject people would graduate on, that is, unless the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; constructed language is objectified as above. It can be an OK course&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to practise certain skill at university, but is it really an academic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subject itself? – **Cerberus**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1912/how-do-i-find-early-adopters-for-a-constructed-language&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/357/111&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6673/linguistics/9898#9898" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

[The sole exception being Esperanto]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With a different audience comes a different culture.  In the conlang world, there is a lot patting on the back and evaluation of conlangs moral, artistic merits, because conlangers are a bunch of artists trying to create something.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conlangs and linguistics do cross path time to time, for example Esperanto is spoken by native speakers, so it is a natural language, too. Some linguists use fake model languages in experimental linguistics, e.g. having subjects learn a few words of a fake language and observing how the people answer questions about it.  These intersections are probably not big enough to warrant merging the conlang proposal and the linguistics SE for the reasons above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the taxonomies that stack exchange uses to divide up human knowledge is imperfect, but they have a difficult task. SE alternative would be to allow all SE sites to become yahoo answer style sites, where everyone can ask anything, and from listening to the StackOverflow podcasts, it was a conscious decision by the sites founders to avoid any-thing-goes question sites.  The down side of this is that some questions (like on conlnags) have no place to be asked and have a really hard task of getting enough followers to start a stack exchange style Q &amp; A site for conlangs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the meanwhile, there are conlang Shapado sites out there, and there is the SE conlang proposal.  Shapado is a stack exchange clone where you can ask questions today (but there isn't an audience) and the SE conlang proposal is ready to go live any decade now.

How many are there?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We currently have 3 diamond moderators on Linguistics.SE. They are (in no particular order):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Alenanno][1]][2] [![Louis Rhys][3]][4][![Otavio Macedo][5]][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also view [a full list of diamond moderators][7] on *all* of the Stack Exchange sites in the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to these community members, members of the Stack Exchange, Inc. team that keeps these sites running have the option to carry diamonds on any site. You can find a list of the team members on [Stack Exchange's team page][8].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 2. What is the job of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are regular members of the community that have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help ensure that the community's issues are properly and promptly addressed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Diamond moderators essentially serve as human &quot;exception handlers&quot;][9]. In addition to the efforts of other users who have earned moderation privileges, diamond moderators will also step in to help keep the site in order. Most of the time, moderators respond to [flags from community members][10].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All diamond moderators must accept the [moderator agreement][11], which essentially states that they must only use their abilities (including access to confidential information) for the good of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 3. What special privileges do diamond moderators have?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - They have access to all the abilities of [trusted users][12], regardless of their reputation.&#xD;&#xA; - Their votes are binding. Any place where users with sufficient privileges can vote—close, open, delete, undelete, spam/offensive, migration, etc.—a diamond moderator's vote is binding and the action takes effect immediately.&#xD;&#xA; - They can lock posts. Locked posts cannot be voted on, commented, or changed in any way.&#xD;&#xA; - They can protect questions. Protected questions cannot be answered by anonymous and very new users, and are used to help keep down spam.&#xD;&#xA; - They can see more data in the system, including general vote statistics (but not specific voting information for individual users or posts) and user profile information.&#xD;&#xA; - They can view all deleted posts on an individual user's profile.&#xD;&#xA; - They can place users in [timed suspension][13], and delete user accounts if necessary.&#xD;&#xA; - They can perform large-scale maintenance actions such as merging questions and tags, tag synonym approvals, question migration to any other site in the network, and so forth.&#xD;&#xA; - They can apply special moderator-only tags on the meta site, which appear in red.&#xD;&#xA; - They can convert a post into &quot;Community Wiki&quot; status, or convert an answer into a comment.&#xD;&#xA; - They can (at their discretion) refund and cancel a bounty.&#xD;&#xA; - They can merge user accounts when requested.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 4. How do we get the attention of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of ways. **The most common way is to [flag the offending post][14] for attention**. Flags show up in a special queue that is visible only to moderators. This is one of the primary ways that you help us improve the site, so **any time you see something bad happening, please use your flags!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that in addition to the canned or stock reasons that appear in the mod flag dialog, **you can also select the &quot;other&quot; option and type a custom message**. This is useful for unusual cases where, for example, you want to report a systemic problem with a particular user. Since you can only flag posts (and not users), just pick one of their posts and explain the problem in a custom flag message.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But please **remember that not all flags are acted upon**! It is up to the discretion of the moderator who processes your flag whether they will take the action you suggest. There are essentially three options: they might agree with your flag and do precisely as you suggest, they might agree with your flag but think some other intervention is indicated, or they might disagree with your flag and think no action is warranted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The decisions made on flags that you have raised are visible in your flagging summary. To view that, click on the number displayed next to the &quot;helpful flags&quot; field in your user profile. Don't let it get you down if a few of your flags are marked &quot;declined&quot;. That's just our way of keeping track of the actions that we take. You only need to be worried that you might be doing something wrong if the *majority* of your flags have been declined (as opposed to marked as &quot;helpful&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to contact a moderator is to **post a question here on the Meta site**. This is likely to be overkill for most purposes, and is mainly used when you want to seek the opinion of the larger community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that **while moderator flags are private, posts on Meta are public**. Therefore, if you might be disclosing sensitive information or making inflammatory accusations against other users, you should probably limit yourself to raising a flag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 5. How are the diamond moderators chosen? Can I become one?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current set of moderators are [*pro tempore* moderators][15]; that is to say, they are not elected, but rather [picked and appointed by Stack Exchange staff members][16].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the usual practice prior to a site graduating from public beta, as there are often not yet enough established community members to [vote in an election][17].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until the site officially launches and a community-wide election is held, there is no mechanism in place for appointing new moderators. In the mean time, you can help improve the site (and help out the diamond moderators) by [earning and exercising moderation privileges][18]. You earn privileges by gaining reputation—in other words, by contributing high-quality questions and answers!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 6. What can I do if I disagree with the action(s) taken by a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators are only human, and *they do make mistakes*! If you think we've made an error in responding to one of your flags, **the easiest thing to do is re-flag the post again**. The second time around, it's probably best to use the &quot;other&quot; field to provide a custom comment that explains your rationale a bit more clearly—we probably just didn't catch onto your concerns the first time around. You can also use this field to ask a *specific* moderator to process your flag, in the unlikely event that you think that one is biased against your concerns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's something a bit more complicated/subjective (perhaps something that would be better discussed by the community at large), or you've already flagged it twice, then **you should post a question about it here on Meta**. Remember to include *all relevant information* in your question, such as a link to the post in question and your exact concerns. The other moderators and community members who didn't/can't see your flag need to know what you're talking about in order to adequately discuss your concerns. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the unlikely event that you're *still* not happy, even after bringing the issue to Meta and soliciting the opinion of the larger community, then **you have one final recourse: you can escalate the issue to the moderators' bosses**. Community moderators are held accountable to and by the Stack Exchange staff. Therefore, if you truly believe that a moderator has abused his/her privileges, you can send an email to **team+philosophy@stackexchange.com**, or alternatively you can post a question on the [global Meta site for the entire Stack Exchange network][19]. But you really do need to discuss it *here* on the Philosophy Meta first. If you skip that step, your complaints elsewhere are less likely to be taken seriously and you may simply end up being pointed here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to Cody Gray for the elaboration of this answer: [Philosophy SE][20].&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TGTzY.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/111/alenanno&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/flair/92.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/92/louis-rhys&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKwNi.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/22/otavio-macedo&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://stackexchange.com/about/moderators&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://stackexchange.com/about/team&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/privileges/trusted-user&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/200/111&#xD;&#xA;  [17]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/&#xD;&#xA;  [18]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges&#xD;&#xA;  [19]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [20]: http://meta.philosophy.stackexchange.com/a/374/1768" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This is one of the primary ways that you help us improve the site, so **any time you see something bad happening, please use your flags!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that in addition to the canned or stock reasons that appear in the mod flag dialog, **you can also select the &quot;other&quot; option and type a custom message**. This is useful for unusual cases where, for example, you want to report a systemic problem with a particular user. Since you can only flag posts (and not users), just pick one of their posts and explain the problem in a custom flag message.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But please **remember that not all flags are acted upon**! It is up to the discretion of the moderator who processes your flag whether they will take the action you suggest. There are essentially three options: they might agree with your flag and do precisely as you suggest, they might agree with your flag but think some other intervention is indicated, or they might disagree with your flag and think no action is warranted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The decisions made on flags that you have raised are visible in your flagging summary. To view that, click on the number displayed next to the &quot;helpful flags&quot; field in your user profile. Don't let it get you down if a few of your flags are marked &quot;declined&quot;. That's just our way of keeping track of the actions that we take. You only need to be worried that you might be doing something wrong if the *majority* of your flags have been declined (as opposed to marked as &quot;helpful&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to contact a moderator is to **post a question here on the Meta site**. This is likely to be overkill for most purposes, and is mainly used when you want to seek the opinion of the larger community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that **while moderator flags are private, posts on Meta are public**. Therefore, if you might be disclosing sensitive information or making inflammatory accusations against other users, you should probably limit yourself to raising a flag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 5. How are the diamond moderators chosen? Can I become one?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current set of moderators are [*pro tempore* moderators][15]; that is to say, they are not elected, but rather [picked and appointed by Stack Exchange staff members][16].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the usual practice prior to a site graduating from public beta, as there are often not yet enough established community members to [vote in an election][17].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until the site officially launches and a community-wide election is held, there is no mechanism in place for appointing new moderators. In the mean time, you can help improve the site (and help out the diamond moderators) by [earning and exercising moderation privileges][18]. You earn privileges by gaining reputation—in other words, by contributing high-quality questions and answers!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 6. What can I do if I disagree with the action(s) taken by a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators are only human, and *they do make mistakes*! If you think we've made an error in responding to one of your flags, **the easiest thing to do is re-flag the post again**. The second time around, it's probably best to use the &quot;other&quot; field to provide a custom comment that explains your rationale a bit more clearly—we probably just didn't catch onto your concerns the first time around. You can also use this field to ask a *specific* moderator to process your flag, in the unlikely event that you think that one is biased against your concerns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's something a bit more complicated/subjective (perhaps something that would be better discussed by the community at large), or you've already flagged it twice, then **you should post a question about it here on Meta**. Remember to include *all relevant information* in your question, such as a link to the post in question and your exact concerns. The other moderators and community members who didn't/can't see your flag need to know what you're talking about in order to adequately discuss your concerns. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the unlikely event that you're *still* not happy, even after bringing the issue to Meta and soliciting the opinion of the larger community, then **you have one final recourse: you can escalate the issue to the moderators' bosses**. Community moderators are held accountable to and by the Stack Exchange staff. Therefore, if you truly believe that a moderator has abused his/her privileges, you can send an email to **team+linguistics@stackexchange.com**, or alternatively you can post a question on the [global Meta site for the entire Stack Exchange network][19]. But you really do need to discuss it *here* on the Linguistics Meta first. If you skip that step, your complaints elsewhere are less likely to be taken seriously and you may simply end up being pointed here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to Cody Gray for the elaboration of this answer: [Philosophy SE][20].&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TGTzY.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/111/alenanno&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/flair/92.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/92/louis-rhys&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKwNi.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/22/otavio-macedo&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://stackexchange.com/about/moderators&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://stackexchange.com/about/team&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges/trusted-user&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/200/111&#xD;&#xA;  [17]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/&#xD;&#xA;  [18]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges&#xD;&#xA;  [19]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [20]: http://meta.philosophy.stackexchange.com/a/374/1768" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Other than the (minor) point that they can be a bit cluttersome for casual visitors, I don't really think discussions in comments are bothersome in any way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, they can be very interesting, constructive, and satisfying. Some of the best parts of certain questions are in comment threads. So I don't think there is a real problem here: I am perfectly fine with discussions in comments. It would be nice if they were actually threaded, though; that way, casual visitors could easily skip long threads, and the problem outlined above would disappear. I wish SE implemented this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to moving a discussion to chat, that usually doesn't work. First of all, many invited users just won't go to chat. They don't want to or don't feel the need to or whatever. Secondly, other users won't see the chat messages in the comment thread, so they will not notice, and they are even less inclined to go to chat, so if any discussion happens there at all, it will nearly always be between two people."

If this gains consensus and traction, I'll propose the devs to introduce the mandatory tags for the Main Site.

Invite professors, students and other linguists you know. If one of their works has been cited in a question or answer, it's worth mentioning that.&#xD;&#xA; 3.

So if we've defined &quot;linguistics&quot; in such a way that Damin and Ge'ez are ruled out, then I'd argue we've *got the wrong definition.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My sense is that the descriptivist/prescriptivist line is the right one to use.  This would have the consequence that we'd have to accept descriptivist questions about Esperanto.  But I don't see the harm there.  If someone has a legitimately descriptive question about Esperanto &amp;mdash; for instance, &quot;Which word order do real-world Esperanto speakers use most in spontaneous face-to-face conversation&quot; &amp;mdash; then I'm totally fine with that.  (And honestly I think most working linguists would be too.  If a student in my department wanted to do fieldwork at Esperanto conventions for their dissertation, I don't think anyone would bat an eye.)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The real problem with Esperanto is that *most* discussions about it *aren't* descriptivist.  The question most commonly discussed isn't &quot;As a matter of descriptive fact, how do Esperantists actually talk?&quot; but rather &quot;How *should* Esperantists talk?&quot; and &quot;Why is Esperanto *better than* Lojban?&quot; and so on.  We should definitely exclude *those* questions.  But we would exclude those questions even if they were about natural languages: &quot;How should Anglophones talk?&quot; and &quot;Why is English better than Spanish?&quot; would be deleted just as quickly.  For that matter, &quot;Why is Damin better than Lardil?&quot; would be deleted.  It's a single consistent standard we can apply across the boad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, if a conlang has *never had* a substantial community of human speakers, then you can't do real linguistics on it, because there's no human verbal behavior there to study.  Even if a conlang does have human speakers, discussing its written grammar isn't linguistics, because it's focusing on a prescribed standard rather than on actual usage.  But if someone wanted to know, like, &quot;As a matter of descriptive fact, how do Klingon speakers at sci-fi cons tend to articulate the phonemes /q͡χ/ and /q/?&quot; then I'd be perfectly happy to see discussion on that point.  (And again, if a student in my department wanted to do that research, we'd be perfectly happy to give 'em a degree in linguistics at the end of it, so long as they did a solid job with the evidence and argumentation.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I realize I may be an extremist here, but I figured I'd put my two cents in."

It seems like a lot more traffic could be brought in by allowing questions that encourage discussion. I use SO, SU, ELU, MathSE, CompSciSE, and LingSE for all questions specific to these topics, but for every other topic, I use Quora. Now, they have a much different setup than SE, namely one that allows *any* kind of question, including extremely subjective ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We've all heard the saying &quot;Never talk about religion or politics&quot; because it can always start an argument, but the funny thing is, on Quora, even a question like &quot;What's the best religion?&quot; doesn't cause problems. These sorts of online Q&amp;A communities mostly have intelligent users that aren't going to be offended by others' views like that. On that particular question, every answer was a long, detailed explanation of their own religion and why the answerer's belief system worked for them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A system that allows subjective questions would certainly be viable on a site like Linguistics StackExchange. Imagine is someone asked &quot;What's the easiest language for a native English speaker to learn?&quot; If this question stipulated that respondents must cite reasons why, I'm sure there would be 5 or 6 answers with detailed explanations as to why an English speaker's mind would be able to absorb a particular language easily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important thing to note here is that this sort of question would **bring in traffic**. There are dozens of lists out there ranking other languages by &quot;difficulty,&quot; but without any specific criteria in sight. Questions like that would surely drive more people to this site through the search engines." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I'm not saying going against the rules, but playing with them. I've often seen in the past questions that could have been subjective but they were open and answered and all. What happened? **The wording**. That's what changed everything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Often you can ask a subjective question but according to the way you do it, it becomes a great question or a very poor question. I suggest you read this blog post, [Good Subjective, Bad Subjective][1]. It explains the reasoning behind the decision of putting this kind of discussions out of our sites, but it also explains how you could ask something that could be subjective but it's really not, check the chapter *&quot;Guidelines for Great Subjective Questions&quot;*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your question cannot be &quot;re-worded&quot; for this purpose, you can also use our [Chat][2]. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm going to tag your question [meta-tag:status-declined] (others can still contribute, if they want, with answers), but I appreciate your interest in our site.

I am a math and linguistics major, and my interests lie in the overlap of these fields, specifically semantics and logic. The main trouble is that my interests are very narrow (and have been so for many years). I undoubtedly want to do math, but I want to do math related to natural-language semantics and prgmatics. Would it be okay to ask for suggestions on schools, departments, or people suitable for me? If so, how could I make the question relevant to a wider audience (i.e., more than just myself)? The question would **not** be along the lines of &quot;what are the best grad programs for linguitics&quot; but rather something like &quot;where can I find people who are working on the following narrow types of problems and also advising grad students&quot;."

There are two main arguments:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Constructed languages are normally not studied in academic linguistics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Constructed languages don't exhibit the same patterns as natural languages, because they were not formed in a &quot;normal&quot; way, and because they are not passed on from parent to child.

This way we'd help you regardless of the difficulty of the question. :) **(2)** The question is more focused on the Linguistics aspect rather than the Usage one, because in that case it'd get off topic. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Anyway, these are guidelines to help everyone provide a better service. If you aren't sure whether your question is on topic or not, you can ask us before you post it, either on [Meta][2] or in [Chat][3].

Please make sure to visit that link in order to see what kind of questions are OK for Conlangs, we might not be able to answer all of them. [Esperanto][6] had already been deemed on topic prior to that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Off Topic questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from the questions considered off topic to any site (see the &quot;What questions should I not ask here&quot; section below), the questions described below are considered off topic:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. *Questions that are not about Linguistics and their subcategories.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. *Translation-request questions.* Asking translations of any kind is off topic on this site. Language-related SE sites usually put this matter off topic if it's a simple question like &quot;Translate this for me&quot;, i.e. providing context and personal efforts can turn that question acceptable. But this site is not meant for any particular language and Linguistics doesn't treat about translation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Still, if your question is about the linguistics reasons for some translations in different languages, etc., then it can be accepted. It will be necessary to check each question, since it's not reasonably possible to treat each case here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you might have noticed, the form counts a lot. Many times the wording/phrasing of your question would make it on topic even if *theoretically* that question asked in a more simple manner would be considered off topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*If you still have questions or doubts that have not been covered until now*, then feel free to bring the matter on the [Meta][7] or in the [chat room][8]; either way, we'll be happy to help you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/331/111&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/11/111&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/433/111&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/367/111&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

What could I do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you honestly think your question was closed wrongly and that it should be reopened, your best bet is Meta. Some suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Don't just post a rant, that won't help you (as in any other situation in life);&#xD;&#xA; - Write constructively about why you think it should have stayed open, the reasons. Expose them in your question in a clear manner. That alone will grant you more positive attention even if we don't agree.&#xD;&#xA; - If it turns out that your question deserved to be closed, accept it and move on. It happens to everybody sooner or later, nothing to be angry about: life is too short for this kind of stuff. In turn, ask if and how you could improve it, the community will certainly help. Alternatively, if nothing works out, consider posting in the Chat: there you can talk about anything that might not work here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What should I not do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you seriously want your question to be reopened, don't act immaturely. Don't insult moderators or fellow users: they don't deserve it and that's only going to ruin your chances (even in the case you truly had). It's not going to help you. It never helped other users. No reason to make it worse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, don't go serially downvoting other people's posts just because they closed your question: actions must be taken **on the posts** and **not on the users**. We are not judging you by closing your question, we are judging your question. Not to mention that this will be seen, your serial downvoting reversed and your account probably suspended; **that's not worth it**. Besides, even moderators get their question closed sometimes; and yes, they stay closed sometimes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators and other users, all of us are human beings, and as such, **we all make mistakes**. So, yes, we can close a question wrongly. We're not robots. If you seriously think a moderator is abusing the powers, email the team using the link you find at the bottom of the page. Remember, however, that normally, moderators do what they think is right. Unless they're abusing, moderators do what they are supposed to do: moderate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But when it happens that your question gets closed, don't post rants in the comments and then disappear. Your question will be deleted sooner or later if you don't do something about it, so why not give it a try and fix it? [Closure is not a permanent state, but it's up to you][1] if it'll be or not. We can certainly help and many of us will, but you must be the first to help yourself. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/248/111" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

They comment in answers, they include parts of the answers in their questions, etc. There are also some more intentional reasons that make some users troublesome but luckily they're not all like that. In any case, I'll try to cover all cases. This is more intended as a guideline, rather than hard rules, but I suggest we all try to follow them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **Be nice and friendly**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Always, always be nice. Well this is actually a rule in the FAQ so, you might say &quot;hey there's nothing new there!&quot;. But being nice (or rather, *nicer*) to new users is even more important. We don't really want to scare them away, do we? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; But how can we be friendly? Well, you don't need acrobatic wording, but a &quot;Hello xxx and welcome to our site!&quot; is the best way to start. It's not enough, but it's a start. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Never attack the user**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; By this, I mean never say things like &quot;What is this crappy question?&quot; et similia. It's *not* going to help. Even the most well-behaved person will feel bothered by that. Use the [Golden Rule][1] that is valid in all life situations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Simple. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Be patient**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Other than being extenuating, communicating with new users can be frustrating if they refuse to cooperate. Be patient with them. This doesn't mean &quot;let them walk over you&quot;. Don't be submissive, but certainly don't attack back: that's not going to help. Ignore personal attacks (i.e. don't answer, but **flag them**) and always answer with facts. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A: You are all against me, this site sucks!   &#xD;&#xA;   B: No, look, we are not targeting you on purpose. The FAQ says that...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If they're serious users, they will apologize and start cooperating. If they're trolls (that is to be decided case by case, there rarely is a clear-cut situation), they will end up being suspended in order to let the community live in peace. Don't feed the trolls.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **Provide resources**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Has the matter being treated in the FAQ? Did we talk about it in a Meta question? *Link them to it.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. **Suggest fixes or edit it yourself**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Voting to close is your right and also your duty. Moderators, when applicable, leave the new user time to fix the question before closing it. In some high-visited sites this is technically impossible, but in small sites, it's possible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; As high-rep users, you can vote to close, but don't hesitate to leave a comment suggesting the OP fixes to improve the question and make it fit. *Close votes expire after a while*, so even if you voted to close and the OP fixed the question, all is well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If the question can be easily fixed by you, *do it*. You have the privilege to edit for a reason. Even if low rep, do it, someone else will revise your edit and approve it if it actually improves the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. **If their answer is short, ask for some explanation**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Asking &quot;Please make it longer or we are going to delete it&quot; is kind of intimidating and might put off people, but it's the truth. So there are two ways to do this. You could use a pro-forma comment (this is mine):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Welcome to (site)! Usually we prefer longer and more elaborated answers on short answers. If you can improve your answer by adding detail, context, examples, and backing up with references, this would increase your answer's quality. Poor and/or repetitive answers risk being down-voted and subsequently removed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; It says the same thing, but look at the wording! :D Another way is ask for an explanation on something. Like&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Welcome to (site)! You didn't treat enough about this point and it looked interesting, mind to expand on it? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Or similar wordings. But you get the point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

In any case, I'll try to cover all cases. This is more intended as a guideline, rather than hard rules, but I suggest we all try to follow them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. ## Be nice and friendly&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Always, always be nice. Well this is actually a rule in the FAQ so, you might say &quot;hey there's nothing new there!&quot;. But being nice (or rather, *nicer*) to new users is even more important. We don't really want to scare them away, do we? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; But how can we be friendly? Well, you don't need acrobatic wording, but a &quot;Hello xxx and welcome to our site!&quot; is the best way to start. It's not enough, but it's a start. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. ## Never attack the user&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; By this, I mean never say things like &quot;What is this crappy question?&quot; et similia. It's *not* going to help. Even the most well-behaved person will feel bothered by that. Use the [Golden Rule][1] that is valid in all life situations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. ## Be patient&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Other than being extenuating, communicating with new users can be frustrating if they refuse to cooperate. Be patient with them. This doesn't mean &quot;let them walk over you&quot;. Don't be submissive, but certainly don't attack back: that's not going to help. Ignore personal attacks (i.e. don't answer, but **flag them**) and always answer with facts. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A: You are all against me, this site sucks!   &#xD;&#xA;   B: No, look, we are not targeting you on purpose. The FAQ says that...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If they're serious users, they will apologize and start cooperating. If they're trolls (that is to be decided case by case, there rarely is a clear-cut situation), they will end up being suspended in order to let the community live in peace. Don't feed the trolls.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. ## Provide resources&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Has the matter being treated in the FAQ? Did we talk about it in a Meta question? *Link them to it.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. ## Suggest fixes or edit it yourself&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Voting to close is your right and also your duty. Moderators, when applicable, leave the new user time to fix the question before closing it. In some high-visited sites this is technically impossible, but in small sites, it's possible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; As high-rep users, you can vote to close, but don't hesitate to leave a comment suggesting the OP fixes to improve the question and make it fit. *Close votes expire after a while*, so even if you voted to close and the OP fixed the question, all is well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If the question can be easily fixed by you, *do it*. You have the privilege to edit for a reason. Even if low rep, do it, someone else will revise your edit and approve it if it actually improves the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. ## If their answer is short, ask for some explanation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Asking &quot;Please make it longer or we are going to delete it&quot; is kind of intimidating and might put off people, but it's the truth. So there are two ways to do this. You could use a pro-forma comment (this is mine):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Welcome to (site)! Usually we prefer longer and more elaborated answers on short answers. If you can improve your answer by adding detail, context, examples, and backing up with references, this would increase your answer's quality. Poor and/or repetitive answers risk being down-voted and subsequently removed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; It says the same thing, but look at the wording! :D Another way is ask for an explanation on something. Like&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Welcome to (site)! You didn't treat enough about this point and it looked interesting, mind to expand on it? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Or similar wordings.

To my slight surprise, this person told me that she actually visited Linguistics at first but then lost interest because of the fact that questions got low-level as she felt that instead a place for researchers, the site was mostly used by non-linguists with a passing interest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason didn't really surprise me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, someone else complained along the same notes. Now, I thought about this and I came to think that Linguistics needs to change its direction. I'm not saying we should close to newbies, enthusiasts. **Linguistics is not and shouldn't be an elitist site.** I'm not sure about what we should do, perhaps we should discourage the simple questions? Or should we instead allow them but with strict requirements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This Meta question is an invite for you to seriously think about what you want this site to be. Our Private Beta is more than one year far away in the past, but we are still in Beta (and even if we already graduated), we can and must need to fix the situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me reiterate: I don't want to drive any non-expert away. Not now, not never. But certainly I don't want experts to disappear either. Quite the opposite, I want them to be attracted to this site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In any case, **I cannot do anything alone**. The community really needs to step up, otherwise I doubt we'll really have any success if not in the *really, really* long term. My opinion is that this is a sort of self-examination: if you really care for the site and want to see it graduate, then this is the moment to do something about it."

A good metaphor: if I were to write this post 90% bold and 10% unboldened text, would you be able to actually determine what parts of the post were important? If you highlight in a textbook and 90% of the page is yellow from the marker, have you actually denoted main ideas and important concepts? The them idea is here; overuse of the system message turns it into Just Another Part of the Site. And we need system message banners to &lt;em&gt;remain unique&lt;/em&gt;.

There's two primary reasons for this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The message gets presented on *every* page of the site, to *every user* of the site for the duration of the display. That's annoying and unwelcome, and our users have [repeatedly](http://meta.serverfault.com/questions/807/is-the-dark-blue-system-notification-bar-annoying) [requested](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64118/allow-us-an-exit-hatch-to-dismiss-the-system-message-notification-bar) [limitations](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/108574/can-we-make-memorial-banners-clickable-to-dismiss) [on their use](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/114020/please-do-not-use-stack-overflow-to-promote-social-causes). &#xD;&#xA; - Second, and perhaps more important, overuse of the system message leads to **blindness to messages when the message is *super* important**. A good metaphor: if I were to write this post 90% bold and 10% unboldened text, would you be able to actually determine what parts of the post were important? If you highlight in a textbook and 90% of the page is yellow from the marker, have you actually denoted main ideas and important concepts?

Generally speaking, we only put them up for things like the site being down for maintenance, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We understand that you're wanting to raise the profile of these contests, but system messages *can't* be the way you do that.

Is it a difference in topics, or a&#xD;&#xA;difference in the background of speakers? How well is the difference&#xD;&#xA;enforced, whatever it may be?

Questions involving phonetics or phonology should ideally include IPA, with the following caveats:&#xD;&#xA;   - Users asking questions come from a variety of backgrounds, so it may not be possible or necessary for them to provide an IPA transcription, depending on the nature of the question.&#xD;&#xA;   - Some languages have orthographies with a straightforward mapping from phonemes to graphemes. Even in the phonological literature, these orthographies are sometimes used, with an accompanying note explaining where symbols depart from IPA usage. I think this would be fine in phonological questions (and others) here too.&#xD;&#xA; 2. For questions not pertaining to phonetics/phonology, a Roman-based orthography is fine. If there are any potentially confusing symbols (especially in less familiar languages), these could be explained with their corresponding IPA symbol or phonetic description.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Non-Roman orthographies are welcome, but they should always be accompanied by at least a transliteration into a Roman-based orthography, if not an IPA transcription."

I'm inspired by a recent [tree question][1], where the post proposes a tree and asks for specific correction (what &quot;to&quot; is). The question does not literally request people to make a tree, but it could be seen as a variant of such a request (such questions are sometimes closed, e.g. [&quot;Lucy reported that scientists wonder if the medicine will work&quot;][2]). The above-mentioned reasons are half about title problems, and I don't understand what the real issue is there. The statement *There's no intuitive way to title them so they all end up as variations of &quot;Syntax tree problem&quot;* is ambiguous. Does that mean &quot;title them in such a way that they...&quot;, or &quot;title them, and therefore they...&quot;. There's an underlying presupposition about titles that I'm not getting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main feature of tree-drawing questions which I find most useless is something that extends to various other questions not even about syntax, namely the class of &quot;please do my homework&quot; questions. That class of questions seem to really meet the objection of there being little chance that the question will ever help anyone but the OP, and it seems to me that &quot;do my homework&quot; questions themselves should be banned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me that the third objection is a particularly relevant one, but it should be more general and also more explicit. In the case of &quot;Lucy reported&quot;, there is no discernable general question, whereas in the question about the infinitive complementizer, there is, and the questions could even have been phrased as &quot;what label immediately dominates infinitival 'to'?&quot;. Thus, on-topic questions should transparently generalize to some class of linguistic phenomena.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, closing vs. not closing questions about syntax trees depends on how some number of readers feel about a question, and the [&quot;Ginny thinks Harry is dreamy&quot;][3] question does in my opinion satisfy the desideratum of generality (it asks about the status of be-Adj phrases and whether be is a &quot;verb&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My reason for posting this answer is to try to create a bit more guidance for posters, so that people will better understand what kinds of questions to not post, and why.

A user kindly provided [this stack app](http://stackapps.com/q/3828) to provide a fly-out keyboard, and in addition there are lots of online character pickers, such as&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://ipa.typeit.org/full/&#xD;&#xA;- https://r12a.github.io/pickers/ipa/&#xD;&#xA;- http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;as well as the [SIL IPA keyboards](http://scripts.sil.org/uniipakeyboard) that can be installed at the OS level. So to my mind the issue of how to get Unicode-encoded IPA symbols into questions and answers seems to be adequately addressed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is inadequate, to my mind, is the typography of IPA characters on the site. It was [suggested here](http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/35/1616) that IPA be rendered using the existing `code formatting` mechanism (surrounding all IPA text with backticks), and instinctively that is what I had been doing anyway, even before seeing that suggestion. It works well for isolated glyphs, but is pretty terrible even for the most common diacritics. For example: `ã` (nasalization), `a̰` (creaky phonation), `ḁ` (devoicing), `a̤` (breathy phonation), `t̪` (dental). It's even worse when you try to use multiple diacritics, e.g.ː `n̠̥` (retracted + devoiced).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this issue can be solved by changing the style sheet for Linguistics SE, so that either:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. text enclosed in backticks is rendered with the [Doulos SIL webfont](http://scripts.sil.org/doulossil_download) or a similarly capable typeface, or&#xD;&#xA;2. text *not* enclosed in backticks is rendered with the [Charis SIL webfont](http://scripts.sil.org/charissil_download) (Charis because it has bold, italic, and bold+italic faces, so it can handle the markdown formatting).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If option 2 is chosen, then obviously the convention would be to *not* use backticks for IPA text, in which case it could optionally be delimited in the usual ways (i.e., [square brackets] for phonetic transcriptions, /slash brackets/ for phonemic transcriptions, &amp;lt;angle brackets&amp;gt; for explicit reference to a glyph and/or its orthographic use)."

I sort of recognize the problem. Here is my screen capture of your original examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's an interaction between font and software, on user's system. Some fonts provide spacing metrics for combining characters &quot;correctly&quot;, and some do not (i.e. Open Type vs. True Type). But the software also needs to be up to speed. So for example Word 2003 handles OTF fonts almost correctly, and Powerpoint 2003 does not (I guess Powerpoint is generally one generation behind Word). I've had similar problems where Word 2010 documents appear to me (using W 2003) as &quot;Vietnamese&quot; and combining characters -- in *some* fonts -- were totally wrong (combining grave was ì and combining acute was Í or vice versa), but the same file in Open Office same era came out correct. The general rule is: apparently nobody understands how to deal with combining characters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't have a &quot;practical&quot; solution for you, other than experiment with changing everything you can imagine, like browsers and fonts. Or maybe there's a system-level compu tweek that's way above my pay-grade.

For exampleː &quot;should I use the single glyph `ʧ` (U+0287) or the sequence `tʃ` (U+0074 U+0283)?&quot; Beware however that the monospaced fonts may do a poorer job of handling IPA than the main text font (especially when using diacritics), so it is probably best to use code formatting only when it makes the question or answer substantially clearer or removes ambiguity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Glosses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Longer or more detailed examples should be presented as three or four line glosses, with the original in the first line, a word by word, or morpheme by morpheme gloss in the second, and a free translation in the third.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately there is no good way to present these in the formatting supported by Stack Exchange. For simple examples you can present them using a quote box, with the first line in italics:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Gwenn eo ar c'haz*  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; White is the cat  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “The cat is white”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more complex examples it helps if the words can be aligned. To do this, write the example in monospaced type by indenting each line with four spaces:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Gwenn  eo  ar   c'haz  &#xD;&#xA;    White  is  the  cat  &#xD;&#xA;    “The cat is white”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Slashes and dashes may be used for compound words:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Bayerische Seenschifffahrt*  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bavarian / lakes-shipping  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Bavarian lakes shipping”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Diagrams and trees&#xD;&#xA;You can use [EL&amp;U's tools for diagramming][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [1]: http://meta.english.stackexchange.com/q/1024" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I personally find that &quot;why&quot; questions have the greatest potential to generate speculative opinion answers, but &quot;what&quot; questions can also generate speculation. &quot;Why&quot; questions are special because they require an abstract theory that predicts the facts, whereas &quot;what&quot;, &quot;when&quot; and &quot;does&quot; can rely more on direct observation.

Preventing people from posting answers to closed or on-hold questions helps prevent this from happening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To protect the OP from being misled**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you answer an unclear question, the OP may think they got what they were looking for, while they actually still have a misunderstanding that nobody was able to address. This being the case, we’d like to encourage the original poster to clarify the question before an answer is posted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Closing a question can send a signal to the OP that they have to communicate what they’re looking for m  ore clearly, and keep paying attention to comments asking for clarification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The /ɔ/ question: my overly-pessimistic, worst-case scenario**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here][1]'s the specific question that seems to be relevant. The problem I have with this question is that it’s not clear about what its purpose is, which I feel is vital for a list question. Since a complete answer is impossible (we can’t list all the words with /ɔ/), we need to know criteria for judging which answers are the most useful for the OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, any answer will have to deal with dialects, since this is something that varies dialectically. But we don’t actually know that the main question is about dialectology. That is only one interpretation of the question. It might actually be about phonetics. The question uses phonemic slashes, true; but it refers to the &quot;/ɔ/ vowel sound&quot; as well as using the symbol &quot;/o/,&quot; which is ambiguous in the context of dialectology, and referring to &quot;open back&quot; counterparts of this vowel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here’s a possible “worst-case scenario” where the questioner doesn’t actually care about dialectology: imagine a person is learning Italian, which has contrastive /o/ and /ɔ/, and wants to learn how to pronounce /ɔ/. This person decides to look for example words in English with [ɔ] to help them learn the vowel sound. They assume that Italian /ɔ/ is phonetically [ɔ], and English /ɔ/ is phonetically [ɔ] (an easy assumption to make, but not necessarily a safe assumption). So, they make a post asking for words with the /ɔ/ sound in English. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Someone responds with a list of a few sample words with the /ɔ/ phoneme, a description of lexical sets, and discussion of how members of this lexical set vary across different American dialects. This would be a great answer to a question about the dialectical phonology of /ɔ/. However, the original poster misses out on learning useful information about the phonetic details that were actually the original motivation for their question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important point about this imaginary scenario is that nobody – the original poster, the answerers, and so on – will be able to realize that the original poster was motivated by an “unsafe assumption,” and missed out on useful information.

Preventing people from posting answers to closed or on-hold questions helps prevent this from happening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To protect the original poster from being misled**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you answer an unclear question, the OP may think they got what they were looking for, while they actually still have a misunderstanding that nobody was able to address. This being the case, we’d like to encourage the original poster to clarify the question before an answer is posted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Closing a question can send a signal to the OP that they have to communicate what they’re looking for more clearly, and keep paying attention to comments asking for clarification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The /ɔ/ question: my overly-pessimistic, worst-case scenario**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here][1]'s the specific question that seems to be relevant. The problem I have with this question is that it’s not clear about what its purpose is, which I feel is vital for a list question. Since a complete answer is impossible (we can’t list all the words with /ɔ/), we need to know criteria for judging which answers are the most useful for the OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, any answer will have to deal with dialects, since this is something that varies dialectically. But we don’t actually know that the main question is about dialectology. That is only one interpretation of the question. It might actually be about phonetics. The question uses phonemic slashes, true; but it refers to the &quot;/ɔ/ vowel sound&quot; as well as using the symbol &quot;/o/,&quot; which is ambiguous in the context of dialectology, and referring to &quot;open back&quot; counterparts of this vowel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here’s a possible “worst-case scenario” where the questioner doesn’t actually care about dialectology: imagine a person is learning Italian, which has contrastive /o/ and /ɔ/, and wants to learn how to pronounce /ɔ/. This person decides to look for example words in English with [ɔ] to help them learn the vowel sound. They assume that Italian /ɔ/ is phonetically [ɔ], and English /ɔ/ is phonetically [ɔ] (an easy assumption to make, but not necessarily a safe assumption). So, they make a post asking for words with the /ɔ/ sound in English. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Someone responds with a list of a few sample words with the /ɔ/ phoneme, a description of lexical sets, and discussion of how members of this lexical set vary across different American dialects. This would be a great answer to a question about the dialectical phonology of /ɔ/. However, the original poster misses out on learning useful information about the phonetic details that were actually the original motivation for their question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important point about this imaginary scenario is that nobody – the original poster, the answerers, and so on – will be able to realize that the original poster was motivated by an “unsafe assumption,” and missed out on useful information. The original poster thinks that they’ve gotten the information they need, and the answerer thinks they’ve provided all the relevant information about /ɔ/ in English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this story far-fetched? Yes. But I don’t think you can disprove this story about the OP of that question, because they have not responded to anyone or clarified what their question is really about.

Certain possibilities could be ruled out on linguistic grounds, like &quot;Bbery&quot; (pronunciation) and it turns out for the same reason &quot;Chehelallieberry&quot; (for reasons having to do with stress conflicts and *h*), but the remainder are equally likely from a linguistic POV. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While linguists are generally aware of the source of the component parts &quot;uni-&quot; and &quot;-corn&quot; and might, given some elementary knowledge of medieval culture be able to see a reason for &quot;unicorn&quot; over &quot;onehorn&quot;, that's just not doable in the case of &quot;Familier&quot;.

IMO closing questions on this grounds is “unfair” because it is not enumerated in the “and is not about” list (advice or help on learning a foreign language; translation requests; trees; things not about linguistics). Nor do I think that you can reasonably infer that language-specific grammar and usage questions are “not about linguistics”, based on the “is about” list. One can conclude that Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic if one has enough reputation to close questions and have actually tried to close a question and encounter this reason; or if you keep track of currently-visible closed questions and see this reason. But I don’t think that is a reasonable requirement for knowing what is off-topic, given that we could simply fix the help center to mention this basis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A dozen questions were closed over the past 90 days on this grounds. An example of a question closed on this basis is the [2-verbs question][1], which asks if having 2 consecutive verbs (in English) means that the first is an auxiliary. The question does not ask about a causal linguistic explanation, it just asks if this is a correct generalization, and it is only about English. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One inference you could make about the “Language-specific” restriction is that questions about a specific language are off-topic. If that is the intent, then we do a poor job of closing questions, because very many questions that don’t get closed are about single languages. Some recent examples (I’m not proposing that these should be closed) are [this][2], [this][3] and [this][4]. These questions do not clearly invoke a scientific linguistic issue (whereas the [Malay copula question][5] is more clearly “concerned with linguistics”). Based on actual patterns of question non-closure, I surmise that a question about a single language which does not have a discernible theoretical linguistic agenda is not per se off topic. I do not know what a ban on language-specific grammar questions is supposed to achieve, and I don’t see how the targeted question-askers could understand what they are not supposed to do. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The “unless” clause (“unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage”) of this closure-ground is also puzzling, since “linguistics” vs. “usage” is a false dichotomy. Not everything is either “about linguistics” or “about usage”, and I do not see what “rather than usage” contributes. The 2-verbs question is basically about a grammatical generalization, though not expressed in terms of any theory of syntax, but it is not about “usage”, at least in any meaning of “usage” that I have ever encountered. I have no idea what kinds of bad things are supposed to be excluded by not allowing questions about usage. Is this code for questions with prescriptive presuppositions (and if so, why do we not simply make clear what our ideological stance is regarding normative topics, even scientific (sociolinguistic) ones?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another example of a “language-specific” question is the [&quot;productivity&quot; question][6] which basically asks whether the semantics of “productivity” and “creativity” are the same.

IMO closing questions on this grounds is “unfair” because it is not enumerated in the “and is not about” list (advice or help on learning a foreign language; translation requests; trees; things not about linguistics). Nor do I think that you can reasonably infer that language-specific grammar and usage questions are “not about linguistics”, based on the “is about” list. One can conclude that Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic if one has enough reputation to close questions and have actually tried to close a question and encounter this reason; or if you keep track of currently-visible closed questions and see this reason. But I don’t think that is a reasonable requirement for knowing what is off-topic, given that we could simply fix the help center to mention this basis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A dozen questions were closed over the past 90 days on this grounds. An example of a question closed on this basis is the [2-verbs question][1], which asks if having 2 consecutive verbs (in English) means that the first is an auxiliary. The question does not ask about a causal linguistic explanation, it just asks if this is a correct generalization, and it is only about English. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One inference you could make about the “Language-specific” restriction is that questions about a specific language are off-topic. If that is the intent, then we do a poor job of closing questions, because very many questions that don’t get closed are about single languages. Some recent examples (I’m not proposing that these should be closed) are [this][2], [this][3] and [this][4]. These questions do not clearly invoke a scientific linguistic issue (whereas the [Malay copula question][5] is more clearly “concerned with linguistics”). Based on actual patterns of question non-closure, I surmise that a question about a single language which does not have a discernible theoretical linguistic agenda is not per se off topic. I do not know what a ban on language-specific grammar questions is supposed to achieve, and I don’t see how the targeted question-askers could understand what they are not supposed to do. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The “unless” clause (“unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage”) of this closure-ground is also puzzling, since “linguistics” vs. “usage” is a false dichotomy. Not everything is either “about linguistics” or “about usage”, and I do not see what “rather than usage” contributes. The 2-verbs question is basically about a grammatical generalization, though not expressed in terms of any theory of syntax, but it is not about “usage”, at least in any meaning of “usage” that I have ever encountered. I have no idea what kinds of bad things are supposed to be excluded by not allowing questions about usage. Is this code for questions with prescriptive presuppositions (and if so, why do we not simply make clear what our ideological stance is regarding normative topics, even scientific (sociolinguistic) ones?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another example of a “language-specific” question is the [&quot;productivity&quot; question][6] which basically asks whether the semantics of “productivity” and “creativity” are the same. In this case, I can see a connection between the question and “usage”, since this is a referential question about semantics, asking whether the extension of the terms is identical (though not using such a fancy term as “extension”). A dumb way to ask whether “cat” and “dog” have the same semantic properties is to ask if they can be felicitously used the same way. I would not have assumed that a question asking about the referential properties of two words is about “usage”, and this is certainly not a violation of any anti-normativity question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The closure of the [&quot;yet-history&quot; question][7] about the historical semantics of English “yet” is likewise puzzling, since it asks about multiple languages (I don’t speak Old English or Middle English but I do speak Modern English, therefore these are not the same language).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now the question part. First, can someone explain the intent of the sentence “Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage”. Second, can we make the help center accurately reflect that intent?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Addendum]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding questions of the type &quot;Do I use on or in with verb X?&quot;, there are a number of ways such a question might be posed (applied to &quot;stand ___ line&quot;, in English). Specifically:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Should I say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&#xD;&#xA; - In Standard English, do you say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&#xD;&#xA; - Do English speakers usually say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&#xD;&#xA; - In English, does the verb &quot;stand&quot; select &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on&quot; before &quot;line&quot; as a complement?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first phrasing is explicitly normative, and the other three are descriptive, thus in some minimal way linguistic. Is it just the first version that should be avoided, or all three? Also, note that I'm only asking about questions that are to be closed, not ones that can be migrated to a different SE site. A valid dichotomy would be between descriptive questions and normative questions. Does it accomplish the intent of the &quot;Language-specific&quot; restriction to say that all normative questions are off-topic? The first version of the question would be OT given that. The other versions of the question ask for factual information. Since &quot;Standard English&quot; is not a well-defined object, the second version of the question would really run afoul of the opinion-based restriction, though applied to some other language with an actual codified standard, there could be such a thing as a correct answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12820/if-two-verbs-are-in-a-row-is-the-first-always-an-auxiliary&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13062/what-accent-for-the-english-language-is-most-widely-and-easily-understood&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13082/north-american-english-r-muscles-and-linguistic-description&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13073/is-the-prefix-proto-reserved-only-for-unattested-languages&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/11373/interrogatives-and-copulas-in-malay&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12911/what-is-the-difference-between-creativity-and-productivity&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12958/what-connects-and-explains-the-many-meanings-of-yet" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

As you explained, questions of one of those kinds can be rephrased into questions of the other kind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This rule gives us a basis for migrating questions to other Stackexchange sites. Not all such questions can be migrated, for instance, when the language-specific question is about meaning or usage, but the language is not currently served by a Stackexchange site. We sometimes get questions about the meaning of phrases in Latin, Sanskrit, etc. This rule gives us a basis for closing the question in such cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding the question on &quot;creativity&quot; vs &quot;productivity&quot;, I understand &quot;productivity&quot; in linguistics, but haven't come across &quot;creativity&quot;. I would have closed the question for being unclear. However, I faulted my own limited expertise in linguistics, and gave the question the benefit of the doubt. To some extent, the questioner is at fault too. He asked about some terms, but did not explain how he currently understands them. And regarding the question on &quot;yet&quot;, all I saw was a bunch of largely related meanings. As with the previous question, my own preference is to close this question for being unclear.

I have no idea what use that information would be to you, though. The quotes from textbooks simply reflect reification of IPA transcriptional practice. An affricate has a complete closure (&quot;a stop&quot;), and there is a significant release sequence. There are different theories of that later aspect, one being the &quot;Dummies&quot; definition which just stipulates the stop-plus-fricative sequence theory (incorrect, in light of Polish stop plus fricative clusters as in [t ʃɨ] vs affricates as in [tʃɨ]), and the Demers et al. definition which points obscurely to the SPE characterization (&quot;releasing secondarily into a fricative&quot;, overly reifying the consequences of the speed of the release, which SPE sees as being only &quot;similar to a fricative&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;separation between the stop and fricative&quot; is not a primary fact about the meaning of the term, it is an artifact of particular contemporary ideologies about affricates. You should focus on the meaning (and ideology) surrounding the first use of the word *qua* linguistic term, in the mid 19th century (as far as I know), which requires knowing who coined the term, and what they were thinking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your question unreasonably assumes that there *should* be a regular and obvious relationship between the wording of the definition for a technical term in a modern textbook, and the much earlier Latin source. This is contrary to the nature of arcane nomenclature, where you have to know the circumstances surrounding first use (e.g. why is the J(/psi) meson called &quot;J&quot;?). The semantic leap from &quot;rub&quot; to &quot;fricative&quot; is the same in nature as from &quot;rub against&quot; to &quot;affricate&quot;, so you should first attempt to trace these linguistic terms back as far as you can. Reading the early texts where &quot;fricative&quot; and &quot;affricate&quot; were first introduced (and knowing what impelled the replacement of &quot;spirant&quot; with &quot;fricative&quot;) is important to understanding the semantic leap in question.

My opinion is that there is already too much superfluous overspecification, such as a distinction between graphemics and graphetics; phonology and morphonology; linguistic anthropology and anthropological linguistics. Since &quot;prosody&quot; or &quot;agreement&quot; aren't explicitly mentioned in this long list, one might mistakenly conclude that questions on those areas of linguistics are considered off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am aware that a terminological distinction is made between NLP and comp-ling, and I still don't understand how NLP isn't just a subset of what is covered by CL. If you can point to a question that was closed or otherwise deprecated because it is &quot;off-topic&quot; and yet is about NLP, that might make a case for clarifying that NLP is on-topic. As I imagine you have surmised, people don't exactly stick to strict and literal interpretations of the off-topic list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not trying to threadjack your question, but by way of comparison, I think that there is a problem with the treatment of a certain class of questions in the area of descriptive linguistics (which is not part of the explicit on-topic list), and that is when people ask questions about facts of languages, they are frequently closed as being off-topic (&quot;language-specific&quot;). These are generally not great questions anyhow, and the ones that are are contextualized in terms of a theoretical linguistic notion and not closed. It is possible that some of these questions would survive if &quot;descriptive linguistics&quot; or &quot;language description&quot; were added to the on-topic list. OTOH, anything that you would &quot;describe&quot; about a language is going to be about the syntax, phonology, phonetics, morphology, graphemics.... of the language, so already covered by an existing category.

On the other hand, when solving certain types of problems, I might say that the variable  is a &quot;digit,&quot; meaning an integer from 0 to 9 (when the base 10 is understood), and in this case it doesn't have a place value.&#xD;&#xA;     &#xD;&#xA;     &#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;**Footnotes**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

'dry' and 'rushing, roaring' are polar opposites;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know that etymology is subjective and speculative, but are there any other conjectures that might possess more conviction?

You should try to write it so there isn't any question about what you're asking. We often have to guess at the intended question based on the title: your title suggests the question is about historical development of languages, but the body asks about how many languages were known to exist at a certain time. The title and body should ask the same question. You include the text &quot;Aramaic etc. -&gt; Hebrew, Arabic&quot; which we can't interpret: I would *guess* that you're claiming that &quot;Aramaic etc.&quot; developed into Hebrew and Arabic, which is false and meaningless given that we don't know what &quot;etc'&quot; refers to. Anyhow, that final bit of text is a distraction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The core of the question seems to be simply &quot;Is it possible to say how many languages where known at that time&quot;. There are two obstacles to answering such a question: (1) known by whom? and (2) at what time. First, you need to refer not to a biblical story, but to a concrete time period -- such as &quot;during the reign of Darius&quot; (okay, too late) or &quot;around 2,000 BC&quot;. Second, you need to contextualize the knowers – I think the answer w.r.t. the Germanic tribes is &quot;a couple&quot;, and the answer w.r.t. the average educated Mesopotamian resident is, errh, dozens, and the answer w.r.t. the handful of people who represent the pinnacle of Mesopotamian science might be a hundred.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a third problem with the question, which might suggest that the question is not suited for this site, but that is not my intention. The problem is that the question almost certainly would only generate speculative opinions and not true facts. Or, it would generate the 1-word answer &quot;no&quot;. I basically made up my numbers, any the next guy can make up different numbers. The problem is that the question reads like a request to know how many languages people were aware of at a certain time, and we have next to no basis for answering that question. The bulk of your question seems to be about that; yet what you as is &quot;Is it possible to say...&quot;, which is really about research methodology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I would think carefully about whether you are asking a methodological question, or a historical-factual question (about actual awareness of languages), and then make the question fit your intent."

Instead, it was set up for linguists and others with an interest in linguistic research and theory. So there's a fundamental divide between scientific questions about language, and fun-facts questions about language. Simply asking &quot;what script is this&quot; is a fun-fact question with no scientific value. It doesn't even lead to describing a property of a script. A question like &quot;how do you determine what the script is&quot; is a method question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That particular question at least *could* be answered.

Both can be long or short but you're not posting an essay, you're posting an answer. There's nothing wrong with an answer being long as long as whatever is inside is related to the question and since questions on SE are meant to have a narrow scope, answers aren't going to be that long because of that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask a broad question, as is your case, then of course answers will have a lot more to cover, but the problem here is not the answers per se, it's the question. We have a close reason for broad questions because SE sites are meant to answer a more or less narrow topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same applies to &quot;discussion&quot;: this is not a forum, there are no discussions, or at least, there aren't any of the same type as those you could find on a forum board.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One of the essays, on the question of intermediate forms in phonological derivations, has not yet been attacked. It is here: Eliminating intermediary forms to account for production and perception. The other essay, on the question of describing grammatical relations as differences in level (in a certain sense), which has been put on hold, is here: How can PSG describe the vertical dimension of sentence structure?.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Attacked&quot;? Maybe you shouldn't use loaded words, there was no attack. I'm just enforcing the rules of a website I've been called to supervise. The question I closed was called to my attention, the other I didn't see until now. I have and it seems fine, but your answers should be reduced to a single answer: just focus on the point of the question, you don't have to present a paper based on it. **Just answer the question.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The official reason cited for putting the second essay on hold was that it is &quot;too broad&quot;, specifically &quot;There are either too many possible answers, or good answers would be too long for this format.

In the comments to my question, two commenters suggested that I reformat my essay as one long answer, as a remedy to the defect they saw in what I wrote, but of course that would make the new answer rather long. So how could that fix the problem of a question requiring a long answer? This does not make sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, a long answer is not the problem if it's necessary to answer a well-scoped question. If the question is OK and you need to give a long answer to cover it, then so be it. I have given long answers myself, but if the question is asking about everything and you give an answer that can easily be made into a paper, this is the wrong place for both the question and the answer. All SE is asking you is to narrow it down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One commenter implied that I shouldn't provide multiple answers to my own question, but I see nothing in the site help files to prohibit this.

In any case, this seems irrelevant to whether my question is really &quot;too broad&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Multiple answers by the same author are rare, it really depends on the question and each case. Typically, there is no need for more than one answer per user, especially on a site like Linguistics. On a site like StackOverflow, this might happen since you provide two different solutions to one problem, for example using different programming languages. But here, there is no case that comes to my mind that could justify that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In conclusion:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Narrow down your question and reword the answers to fit in one. If you really don't want to lose all that material, start a Linguistics blog and you can even link to it from your answer for &quot;additional context&quot;. There was the possibility to create blogs on SE sites, but apparently it has been discontinued. If you want to create one for Linguistics SE, I won't be opposed, and on the contrary, I think it'd be a nice idea. You can try contacting SE directly and see if something can be done. Of course, this means that you should commit yourself to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Merge the answers on the other question, which doesn't seem broad to me, and that's why I'm not closing it for now.

A question does not have to be at such a basic level such that every person on the planet will instantly understand it, but it should be possible for someone who doesn't to come to an understanding in a reasonable amount of time. Questions concerning obscure topics such as yours should be accompanied by links or citations to books.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I search [Google for &quot;vertical dimension of sentence structure&quot;](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=vertical+dimension+of+sentence+structure), the first result is your own question, which is not a good sign. The [second result](http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/Syntax/TheHorizontalAndVerticalDimensionOfSentences) doesn't seem to be about anything other than the idea that linguists draw syntax trees. Down further is a [Wikipedia article on Catena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catena_(linguistics)), a topic in dependency grammars, which does seem similar to your answers, but it doesn't mention declensions or case which your question does. Other responses link to several books in Google Books. In none of these is it clear that they are talking about what you are asking about. For this reason it is completely appropriate that your question be closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But in fact, as you wrote in [a comment](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/17271/how-can-psg-describe-the-vertical-dimension-of-sentence-structure#comment41397_17271), this concept of a &quot;vertical dimension&quot; is an original feature of your theory! I would not have a problem with someone presenting a new linguistic theory or framework in order to answer another question. But you can't ask a question ***about*** a new theory, one which **no one but you understands!** That's completely ridiculous!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answers can be 30000 characters long, or about 5000 words. Very occasionally a very detailed answer will need to be broken up into two posts, but I've only seen one or two such posts which I thought actually warranted that level of detail. Your ten answers come to just over 20000 characters. Even accounting for formatting they would fit comfortably in a single post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But posting a multi part answer is a distraction from the real problem with your question. You have a new theory, and I guess you want some feedback on it. You have in effect posted a moderate length research article here. You should not be posting it here, you should be submitting it to a journal.

As [I wrote before](http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/574/2555) corpus analysis is computation but not natural language processing (if that has the normal meaning of machine parsing and interpretation). There are many statistical approaches to linguistics which have nothing to do with nlp.

I don't know how to explicate modality in the sense of spoken/written/signed, is there a good adjective to add?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13039/is-the-idea-of-simultaneity-in-sign-language-as-opposed-to-linearity-in-spok" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Whether or not the accumulation of a set of resources is acceptable on the site, it is important that it should be framed in a way that is not a poll or survey.

Note that my comments on Community Wiki specifically are about using it as an *excuse for acceptability*. If you are leveraging the lowered-edit-barrier on an answer, that's fine and also has nothing to do with acceptability. Also it has no need for community wiki to be applied on the question itself. Focus less on that point, more on the parts about framing and expectations of a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm generally opposed to these &quot;repository&quot; style questions because they never quite do what they must properly do. The more maintenance that is required for a repository, the less tends to get done in order to keep it in top shape. To quote from my UX answer,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The solution to a list question is a complete list of all the items that could possibly apply to the author's needs in an expert manner. This is something that has never really been successfully accomplished with how these list questions play out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unlike the UX example which is a lot more broadly approached (as it is about repositories in general), this example is specifically targeted at the problem of &quot;Getting Started in Linguistics&quot;. That is a topic which has the potential to be a powerful resource on this site, if properly maintained and constructed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd still prefer that this be done in a fashion *other* than listing reading material on the subject matter. Focus more on the overall concerns of getting started, not just on books. There's no reason that book recommendations can't be a *part* of this process, but making it the goal of the question just tends to open up a lot more problems than it solves.

Who are the diamond moderators? How many are there?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We currently have 3 diamond moderators on Linguistics.SE. They are (in no particular order):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Alenanno][1]][2] [![Louis Rhys][3]][4][![Otavio Macedo][5]][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also view [a full list of diamond moderators][7] on *all* of the Stack Exchange sites in the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to these community members, members of the Stack Exchange, Inc. team that keeps these sites running have the option to carry diamonds on any site. You can find a list of the team members on [Stack Exchange's team page][8].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 2. What is the job of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are regular members of the community that have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help ensure that the community's issues are properly and promptly addressed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Diamond moderators essentially serve as human &quot;exception handlers&quot;][9]. In addition to the efforts of other users who have earned moderation privileges, diamond moderators will also step in to help keep the site in order. Most of the time, moderators respond to [flags from community members][10].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All diamond moderators must accept the [moderator agreement][11], which essentially states that they must only use their abilities (including access to confidential information) for the good of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 3. What special privileges do diamond moderators have?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - They have access to all the abilities of [trusted users][12], regardless of their reputation.&#xD;&#xA; - Their votes are binding. Any place where users with sufficient privileges can vote—close, open, delete, undelete, spam/offensive, migration, etc.—a diamond moderator's vote is binding and the action takes effect immediately.&#xD;&#xA; - They can lock posts. Locked posts cannot be voted on, commented, or changed in any way.&#xD;&#xA; - They can protect questions. Protected questions cannot be answered by anonymous and very new users, and are used to help keep down spam.&#xD;&#xA; - They can see more data in the system, including general vote statistics (but not specific voting information for individual users or posts) and user profile information.&#xD;&#xA; - They can view all deleted posts on an individual user's profile.&#xD;&#xA; - They can place users in [timed suspension][13], and delete user accounts if necessary.&#xD;&#xA; - They can perform large-scale maintenance actions such as merging questions and tags, tag synonym approvals, question migration to any other site in the network, and so forth.&#xD;&#xA; - They can apply special moderator-only tags on the meta site, which appear in red.&#xD;&#xA; - They can convert a post into &quot;Community Wiki&quot; status, or convert an answer into a comment.&#xD;&#xA; - They can (at their discretion) refund and cancel a bounty.&#xD;&#xA; - They can merge user accounts when requested.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 4. How do we get the attention of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of ways. **The most common way is to [flag the offending post][14] for attention**. Flags show up in a special queue that is visible only to moderators. This is one of the primary ways that you help us improve the site, so **any time you see something bad happening, please use your flags!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that in addition to the canned or stock reasons that appear in the mod flag dialog, **you can also select the &quot;other&quot; option and type a custom message**. This is useful for unusual cases where, for example, you want to report a systemic problem with a particular user. Since you can only flag posts (and not users), just pick one of their posts and explain the problem in a custom flag message.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But please **remember that not all flags are acted upon**! It is up to the discretion of the moderator who processes your flag whether they will take the action you suggest. There are essentially three options: they might agree with your flag and do precisely as you suggest, they might agree with your flag but think some other intervention is indicated, or they might disagree with your flag and think no action is warranted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The decisions made on flags that you have raised are visible in your flagging summary. To view that, click on the number displayed next to the &quot;helpful flags&quot; field in your user profile. Don't let it get you down if a few of your flags are marked &quot;declined&quot;. That's just our way of keeping track of the actions that we take. You only need to be worried that you might be doing something wrong if the *majority* of your flags have been declined (as opposed to marked as &quot;helpful&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to contact a moderator is to **post a question here on the Meta site**. This is likely to be overkill for most purposes, and is mainly used when you want to seek the opinion of the larger community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that **while moderator flags are private, posts on Meta are public**. Therefore, if you might be disclosing sensitive information or making inflammatory accusations against other users, you should probably limit yourself to raising a flag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 5. How are the diamond moderators chosen? Can I become one?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current set of moderators are [*pro tempore* moderators][15]; that is to say, they are not elected, but rather [picked and appointed by Stack Exchange staff members][16].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the usual practice prior to a site graduating from public beta, as there are often not yet enough established community members to [vote in an election][17].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until the site officially launches and a community-wide election is held, there is no mechanism in place for appointing new moderators. In the mean time, you can help improve the site (and help out the diamond moderators) by [earning and exercising moderation privileges][18]. You earn privileges by gaining reputation—in other words, by contributing high-quality questions and answers!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 6. What can I do if I disagree with the action(s) taken by a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators are only human, and *they do make mistakes*! If you think we've made an error in responding to one of your flags, **the easiest thing to do is re-flag the post again**. The second time around, it's probably best to use the &quot;other&quot; field to provide a custom comment that explains your rationale a bit more clearly—we probably just didn't catch onto your concerns the first time around. You can also use this field to ask a *specific* moderator to process your flag, in the unlikely event that you think that one is biased against your concerns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's something a bit more complicated/subjective (perhaps something that would be better discussed by the community at large), or you've already flagged it twice, then **you should post a question about it here on Meta**. Remember to include *all relevant information* in your question, such as a link to the post in question and your exact concerns. The other moderators and community members who didn't/can't see your flag need to know what you're talking about in order to adequately discuss your concerns. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the unlikely event that you're *still* not happy, even after bringing the issue to Meta and soliciting the opinion of the larger community, then **you have one final recourse: you can escalate the issue to the moderators' bosses**. Community moderators are held accountable to and by the Stack Exchange staff. Therefore, if you truly believe that a moderator has abused his/her privileges, you can send an email to **team+linguistics@stackexchange.com**, or alternatively you can post a question on the [global Meta site for the entire Stack Exchange network][19]. But you really do need to discuss it *here* on the Linguistics Meta first. If you skip that step, your complaints elsewhere are less likely to be taken seriously and you may simply end up being pointed here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to Cody Gray for the elaboration of this answer: [Philosophy SE][20].&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TGTzY.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/111/alenanno&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/flair/92.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/92/louis-rhys&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKwNi.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/22/otavio-macedo&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://stackexchange.com/about/moderators&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://stackexchange.com/about/team&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges/trusted-user&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: http://meta.linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/200/111&#xD;&#xA;  [17]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/&#xD;&#xA;  [18]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges&#xD;&#xA;  [19]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [20]: https://philosophy.meta.stackexchange.com/a/374/1768" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The problem is that it invites opinion (or speculation) over personal experience; other than that I don't think it breaks any of the guidelines.  One suggestion I made in the original thread: Solicit personal experiences on what works and what doesn't in running linguistic discussions for laypeople.  (Perhaps nobody will have personal experiences about running a linguistics *book club,* but I'm guessing some of us will have experience with running popular linguistic discussions more generally.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second: I suggested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/bad-statistics-what-can-we-do&quot;&gt;bad stats thread&lt;/a&gt; that we should aim to help people with practical goals if we want to strengthen the user community here.  This strikes me as a good example of that: someone has a practical goal that's related to linguistics, they have a question about how to achieve that goal, and we are in a position to give answers.  Good answers will be linguistics-related.  (It would be fine to exclude non-linguistics-related answers like &quot;Put up an ad on Craigslist!&quot; or &quot;Make sure to serve snacks!&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, I think it is very much in our best interest to find some way of refining or redirecting questions like these rather than simply downvoting and closing.

After that the winner is selected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. **Wait, a draw? So it's random?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Well... Yes. But your work is still important! Basically (data by the end of the Challenge):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - 1 Question with 50 views is 1 lot in the draw.&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - Every +50 is a +1 lot in the draw, so 150 views = 3 lots&#xD;&#xA; &gt; - Every additional question with 50 views is 1 lot. So 3 questions with 50 views each = 3 lots.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Therefore, the **more questions you ask** and the **more you share** ➝ the **more chances you'll have to win**!&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 7. **What do I win?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; The **GLORY** of being among the first winners of the Linguistics SE Challenge Week series! :P&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Good luck!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/251/111&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/230/111&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/231/111&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NgESU.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

You can use [this scheme][1] to guide you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if your question is about **Phonology**, then you should tag the question [tag:phonology] and [tag:theoretical-linguistics] since Phonology belongs to that part of Linguistics. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/332/111" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This way we'd help you regardless of the difficulty of the question. :) **(2)** The question is more focused on the Linguistics aspect rather than the Usage one, because in that case it'd get off topic. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Anyway, these are guidelines to help everyone provide a better service. If you aren't sure whether your question is on topic or not, you can ask us before you post it, either on [Meta][2] or in [Chat][3]. Don't worry if there is no-one in chat at that moment, you can leave the message there and we'll reply as soon as we see it. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. *Questions about Sign Languages and [writing systems][4]*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9. *Questions about fictional/constructed/planned languages.* After the Conlang SE was closed and subsequently deleted, we have decided to accept [Conlangs][5]. Please make sure to visit that link in order to see what kind of questions are OK for Conlangs, we might not be able to answer all of them. [Esperanto][6] had already been deemed on topic prior to that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Off Topic questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from the questions considered off topic to any site (see the &quot;What questions should I not ask here&quot; section below), the questions described below are considered off topic:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. *Questions that are not about Linguistics and their subcategories.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. *Translation-request questions.* Asking translations of any kind is off topic on this site. Language-related SE sites usually put this matter off topic if it's a simple question like &quot;Translate this for me&quot;, i.e. providing context and personal efforts can turn that question acceptable. But this site is not meant for any particular language and Linguistics doesn't treat about translation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Still, if your question is about the linguistics reasons for some translations in different languages, etc., then it can be accepted. It will be necessary to check each question, since it's not reasonably possible to treat each case here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you might have noticed, the form counts a lot. Many times the wording/phrasing of your question would make it on topic even if *theoretically* that question asked in a more simple manner would be considered off topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*If you still have questions or doubts that have not been covered until now*, then feel free to bring the matter on the [Meta][7] or in the [chat room][8]; either way, we'll be happy to help you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/331/111&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11/111&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/433/111&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/367/111&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Who are the diamond moderators? How many are there?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We currently have 3 diamond moderators on Linguistics.SE. They are (in no particular order):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Alenanno][1]][2] [![Louis Rhys][3]][4][![Otavio Macedo][5]][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also view [a full list of diamond moderators][7] on *all* of the Stack Exchange sites in the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to these community members, members of the Stack Exchange, Inc. team that keeps these sites running have the option to carry diamonds on any site. You can find a list of the team members on [Stack Exchange's team page][8].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 2. What is the job of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are regular members of the community that have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help ensure that the community's issues are properly and promptly addressed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Diamond moderators essentially serve as human &quot;exception handlers&quot;][9]. In addition to the efforts of other users who have earned moderation privileges, diamond moderators will also step in to help keep the site in order. Most of the time, moderators respond to [flags from community members][10].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All diamond moderators must accept the [moderator agreement][11], which essentially states that they must only use their abilities (including access to confidential information) for the good of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 3. What special privileges do diamond moderators have?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - They have access to all the abilities of [trusted users][12], regardless of their reputation.&#xD;&#xA; - Their votes are binding. Any place where users with sufficient privileges can vote—close, open, delete, undelete, spam/offensive, migration, etc.—a diamond moderator's vote is binding and the action takes effect immediately.&#xD;&#xA; - They can lock posts. Locked posts cannot be voted on, commented, or changed in any way.&#xD;&#xA; - They can protect questions. Protected questions cannot be answered by anonymous and very new users, and are used to help keep down spam.&#xD;&#xA; - They can see more data in the system, including general vote statistics (but not specific voting information for individual users or posts) and user profile information.&#xD;&#xA; - They can view all deleted posts on an individual user's profile.&#xD;&#xA; - They can place users in [timed suspension][13], and delete user accounts if necessary.&#xD;&#xA; - They can perform large-scale maintenance actions such as merging questions and tags, tag synonym approvals, question migration to any other site in the network, and so forth.&#xD;&#xA; - They can apply special moderator-only tags on the meta site, which appear in red.&#xD;&#xA; - They can convert a post into &quot;Community Wiki&quot; status, or convert an answer into a comment.&#xD;&#xA; - They can (at their discretion) refund and cancel a bounty.&#xD;&#xA; - They can merge user accounts when requested.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 4. How do we get the attention of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of ways. **The most common way is to [flag the offending post][14] for attention**. Flags show up in a special queue that is visible only to moderators. This is one of the primary ways that you help us improve the site, so **any time you see something bad happening, please use your flags!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that in addition to the canned or stock reasons that appear in the mod flag dialog, **you can also select the &quot;other&quot; option and type a custom message**. This is useful for unusual cases where, for example, you want to report a systemic problem with a particular user. Since you can only flag posts (and not users), just pick one of their posts and explain the problem in a custom flag message.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But please **remember that not all flags are acted upon**! It is up to the discretion of the moderator who processes your flag whether they will take the action you suggest. There are essentially three options: they might agree with your flag and do precisely as you suggest, they might agree with your flag but think some other intervention is indicated, or they might disagree with your flag and think no action is warranted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The decisions made on flags that you have raised are visible in your flagging summary. To view that, click on the number displayed next to the &quot;helpful flags&quot; field in your user profile. Don't let it get you down if a few of your flags are marked &quot;declined&quot;. That's just our way of keeping track of the actions that we take. You only need to be worried that you might be doing something wrong if the *majority* of your flags have been declined (as opposed to marked as &quot;helpful&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to contact a moderator is to **post a question here on the Meta site**. This is likely to be overkill for most purposes, and is mainly used when you want to seek the opinion of the larger community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that **while moderator flags are private, posts on Meta are public**. Therefore, if you might be disclosing sensitive information or making inflammatory accusations against other users, you should probably limit yourself to raising a flag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 5. How are the diamond moderators chosen? Can I become one?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current set of moderators are [*pro tempore* moderators][15]; that is to say, they are not elected, but rather [picked and appointed by Stack Exchange staff members][16].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the usual practice prior to a site graduating from public beta, as there are often not yet enough established community members to [vote in an election][17].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until the site officially launches and a community-wide election is held, there is no mechanism in place for appointing new moderators. In the mean time, you can help improve the site (and help out the diamond moderators) by [earning and exercising moderation privileges][18]. You earn privileges by gaining reputation—in other words, by contributing high-quality questions and answers!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 6. What can I do if I disagree with the action(s) taken by a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators are only human, and *they do make mistakes*! If you think we've made an error in responding to one of your flags, **the easiest thing to do is re-flag the post again**. The second time around, it's probably best to use the &quot;other&quot; field to provide a custom comment that explains your rationale a bit more clearly—we probably just didn't catch onto your concerns the first time around. You can also use this field to ask a *specific* moderator to process your flag, in the unlikely event that you think that one is biased against your concerns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's something a bit more complicated/subjective (perhaps something that would be better discussed by the community at large), or you've already flagged it twice, then **you should post a question about it here on Meta**. Remember to include *all relevant information* in your question, such as a link to the post in question and your exact concerns. The other moderators and community members who didn't/can't see your flag need to know what you're talking about in order to adequately discuss your concerns. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the unlikely event that you're *still* not happy, even after bringing the issue to Meta and soliciting the opinion of the larger community, then **you have one final recourse: you can escalate the issue to the moderators' bosses**. Community moderators are held accountable to and by the Stack Exchange staff. Therefore, if you truly believe that a moderator has abused his/her privileges, you can send an email to **team+linguistics@stackexchange.com**, or alternatively you can post a question on the [global Meta site for the entire Stack Exchange network][19]. But you really do need to discuss it *here* on the Linguistics Meta first. If you skip that step, your complaints elsewhere are less likely to be taken seriously and you may simply end up being pointed here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to Cody Gray for the elaboration of this answer: [Philosophy SE][20].&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TGTzY.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/111/alenanno&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/flair/92.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/92/louis-rhys&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKwNi.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/22/otavio-macedo&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://stackexchange.com/about/moderators&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://stackexchange.com/about/team&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges/trusted-user&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/200/111&#xD;&#xA;  [17]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/&#xD;&#xA;  [18]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges&#xD;&#xA;  [19]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [20]: https://philosophy.meta.stackexchange.com/a/374/1768" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Some suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Don't just post a rant, that won't help you (as in any other situation in life);&#xD;&#xA; - Write constructively about why you think it should have stayed open, the reasons. Expose them in your question in a clear manner.

It happens to everybody sooner or later, nothing to be angry about: life is too short for this kind of stuff. In turn, ask if and how you could improve it, the community will certainly help. Alternatively, if nothing works out, consider posting in the Chat: there you can talk about anything that might not work here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What should I not do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you seriously want your question to be reopened, don't act immaturely. Don't insult moderators or fellow users: they don't deserve it and that's only going to ruin your chances (even in the case you truly had). It's not going to help you. It never helped other users. No reason to make it worse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, don't go serially downvoting other people's posts just because they closed your question: actions must be taken **on the posts** and **not on the users**. We are not judging you by closing your question, we are judging your question. Not to mention that this will be seen, your serial downvoting reversed and your account probably suspended; **that's not worth it**. Besides, even moderators get their question closed sometimes; and yes, they stay closed sometimes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators and other users, all of us are human beings, and as such, **we all make mistakes**. So, yes, we can close a question wrongly. We're not robots. If you seriously think a moderator is abusing the powers, email the team using the link you find at the bottom of the page. Remember, however, that normally, moderators do what they think is right. Unless they're abusing, moderators do what they are supposed to do: moderate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But when it happens that your question gets closed, don't post rants in the comments and then disappear. Your question will be deleted sooner or later if you don't do something about it, so why not give it a try and fix it? [Closure is not a permanent state, but it's up to you][1] if it'll be or not. We can certainly help and many of us will, but you must be the first to help yourself. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/248/111" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There is a specific point about the [&quot;Not 'Please make me a tree'&quot;][1] rule which I raise in my answer, the gist of which being that I don't think it is clear enough what constitutes a what-not-to-do. It was suggested that I raise the broader question. I find the guidance a bit too minimal, especially in terms of giving functional explanations for the guidelines that would allow users to better filter and frame their questions. My underlying assumption is that people will better understand what to do if they know why that's what they should do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One question is whether &quot;do my homework for me&quot; questions should be allowed. IMO, they should not be: and we should say so. However, there is nothing in the help center ([about][2], [on-topic][3], [dont-ask][4]) that suggests that this place *isn't* among other things a free answer-giving service. On-topic starts by saying who LSE is for, but not what purpose it serves. This was pointed out as the second point in [this][5] meta-discussion. The off-topic list stipulates that syntax trees, translation, and foreign-language learning help are out, but no reason is given (it also fails to include &quot;language identification&quot; questions). I would exclude such questions as having no general value -- knowing that Իմ անկյուն ցավում է is Armenian or that it means &quot;My elbow hurts&quot; is not a fact which can be applied to any other scientific linguistic inquiry. IMO, a question should be about something conceptual and general. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a discussion of homework questions [here][6], and I don't see any support for answering people's homeworks for them. Some of the points raised in that discussion are that questions about homeworks should show signs of &quot;making an effort&quot;, and that in principle, such questions might indirectly point to a question of general interest, so &quot;How do you draw 'I want to go home'?&quot; might lead to a question whether &quot;go home&quot; is a VP, but it also might lead to a question about S dominating &quot;to go home&quot;. Might in principle, eventually, but doesn't, when framed as &quot;How do you draw this tree&quot; (there are analogous issues in phonology, morphology, historical etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe that we should explicitly say &quot;Do not ask us to do your homework for you&quot;, while admiting that homeworks can *lead to* appropriate questions. Then we should relate homeworks to what a good question is, specifically saying something to the effect that in answering a homework, you may discover that you don't know a specific think about the problem, like you don't know how to employ the concepts &quot;phoneme&quot; versus &quot;contrast&quot; in your answer, and this leads to a more general question -- the question that you should ask -- of what the difference is between these concepts. This would be a good (enough) question because the answer applies to any number of specific instances. We should relate homeworks to the desideratum of &quot;showing some effort&quot;, saying something like &quot;explain what part you *do* understand, and what alternatives you are considering&quot;, though I would frame this in terms of providing context, to which we should add &quot;Make clear your framework assumptions&quot;, since analysis questions have many answers, depending on whether you're doing Categorial Grammar, Minimalism, Classical Aspects (anybody??), HPSG, LFG, or whatever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So my suggestion is that we need some higher-level (help center) identification of the purpose of the site, and some elaboration of why asking for homework answers, translations and language identification is contrary to that purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;{ADDENDUM}&#xD;&#xA;[Here][7] is a recent example of someone asking for a solution to a phonology problem, and an exemplar of what should be off topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/529/should-we-make-questions-about-specific-syntax-trees-off-topic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/tour&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/209/about-questions-salvaging&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/313/is-it-a-good-idea-to-encourage-answering-home-work-questions&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/11323/determining-underlying-representation" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I also think that someone else substantially editing a question to change what it asks is a bad idea -- the OP should decide what he/she really means, and then remove the ambiguity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not clear to me what purpose closing a question serves, and without knowing that, it's hard to say whether the answer to the question &quot;should this question be closed&quot; is yes or no. It could serve as a warning to others not to ask questions like that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hate to be critical but there is usually not much useful feedback about the nature of the problem (and it's often inconsistent, e.g. both &quot;too broad&quot; and &quot;too narrow&quot;), so it's difficult to discern what the &quot;questions like that&quot; would be. The defined labels are both too broad and too narrow, so voters have to approximate by picking the closest label. Ideally, there would be a physical requirement to add a comment in order to vote to close, but I imagine the software has its limits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, I think it's ultimately counterproductive to flag comments, unless the content is plainly offensive or rude. Instead, you should counter-comment, explaining why the terminology *is* clear: answer with facts. I often find that the wording can be interpreted in two ways, but the commenters don't identify the two readings (and even when the unclarity is pointed out, the OP prequently doesn't bother to fix the ambiguity, especially the casual passer-by poster).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ANOTHER EDIT:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Curiousdannii's rationale for closing questions seems valid, especially the &quot;signpost&quot; consideration. However, I now see that closed questions are auto-deleted (the exact rule is unknown to me), which negates the educational function of closing a function. I would say that this is an argument against closing as opposed to leaving on hold.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/584/can-we-give-better-guidance-on-questions" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

A user kindly provided [this stack app](http://stackapps.com/q/3828) to provide a fly-out keyboard, and in addition there are lots of online character pickers, such as&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://ipa.typeit.org/full/&#xD;&#xA;- https://r12a.github.io/pickers/ipa/&#xD;&#xA;- http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;as well as the [SIL IPA keyboards](http://scripts.sil.org/uniipakeyboard) that can be installed at the OS level. So to my mind the issue of how to get Unicode-encoded IPA symbols into questions and answers seems to be adequately addressed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is inadequate, to my mind, is the typography of IPA characters on the site. It was [suggested here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/35/1616) that IPA be rendered using the existing `code formatting` mechanism (surrounding all IPA text with backticks), and instinctively that is what I had been doing anyway, even before seeing that suggestion. It works well for isolated glyphs, but is pretty terrible even for the most common diacritics. For example: `ã` (nasalization), `a̰` (creaky phonation), `ḁ` (devoicing), `a̤` (breathy phonation), `t̪` (dental). It's even worse when you try to use multiple diacritics, e.g.ː `n̠̥` (retracted + devoiced).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this issue can be solved by changing the style sheet for Linguistics SE, so that either:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. text enclosed in backticks is rendered with the [Doulos SIL webfont](http://scripts.sil.org/doulossil_download) or a similarly capable typeface, or&#xD;&#xA;2. text *not* enclosed in backticks is rendered with the [Charis SIL webfont](http://scripts.sil.org/charissil_download) (Charis because it has bold, italic, and bold+italic faces, so it can handle the markdown formatting).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If option 2 is chosen, then obviously the convention would be to *not* use backticks for IPA text, in which case it could optionally be delimited in the usual ways (i.e., [square brackets] for phonetic transcriptions, /slash brackets/ for phonemic transcriptions, &amp;lt;angle brackets&amp;gt; for explicit reference to a glyph and/or its orthographic use).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a screenshot of what I see on Firefox 37.0.1 on Linux:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Screenshot of diacritic rendering][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a second screenshot of diacritics in one of the comments (with a little shading added to make more clear the relevant parts):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Another screenshot of diacritic rendering][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Presumably that devoicing ring is supposed to be on the final `a`, not on the `e` in &quot;etc&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ny3XU.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4UDwG.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Briefly: linguists often need to add diacritics to distinguish speech sounds, and diacritics don't align properly in some typefaces (the question has a couple screenshots if you're curious). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Liberation Mono was the culprit in my case, whereas DejaVu Sans Mono does better, but is lower in the CSS `font-family` list for the `code` class. Could we reverse the order of those two typefaces in the SE CSS? I haven't done a thorough testing of the other typefaces higher in the list to see how well they handle diacritics, but if that's a condition for getting this changed I'm willing to do so (at least for the ones that are free)."

There are many language-specific sites where such questions are welcomed; see: http://stackexchange.com/sites&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I comprehend that prescriptive questions (eg: of usage) are off-topic, but what of  questions necessitating linguistics knowledge about a specific language? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, though language-specific sites feature native speakers, they may not be linguists and so would be unable to answer a question as helpfully or meaningfully as here. For example, [this question](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/14876/does-etymology-explain-linguisticss-definitions-of-tone-and-intonation?noredirect=1#comment37665_14876) presupposes knowledge of the linguistic definition of 'tone' and 'intonation', and so would necessitate a linguist's attention, not simply anyone who knows Latin. The same problem exists for questions of Historical Linguistics for one language X; for example, most native speakers of X cannot connect an English or French Word to Proto-X as only a linguist can. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Example Question as a Test:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`Title:` How else might the Latin 'torrere' have drifted semantically to mean 'rushing, roaring (of streams)'?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`Question`: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[[Etymonline]](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=torrent) [...] from Latin *torrentem* (nominative *torrens*) &quot;rushing, roaring&quot; (of streams), also &quot;a rushing stream,&quot; originally as an adjective &quot;roaring, boiling, burning, parching, hot, inflamed,&quot; present participle of *torrere* &quot;to parch&quot; (see [terrain](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=terrain&amp;allowed_in_frame=0)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Google revealed only [one conjecture](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KDuAaVDUxb8J:mittani.blogspot.com/2009/06/notes-on-etymology-of-torrent.html+&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;So, what could be the connection between a rushing stream and something which is dried out, thirsting for some water?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Supposedly, the contrasting meanings are linked by the image of a mountain creek or river which may be a raging current in spring, but dries out in summer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Somehow the above is unpersuasive, probably because:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. most raging streams do not dry;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. it is factually false to refer to a dried raging stream still as a `raging stream``; one would have said 'dried raging stream'. 'dry' and 'rushing, roaring' are polar opposites;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know that etymology is subjective and speculative, but are there any other conjectures that might possess more conviction?

A similar request was already made on meta [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1662/feature-request-let-us-easily-write-in-ipa-and-tree-diagrams).  &#xD;&#xA;This is where I don't know for sure what is technically possible: Since trees are not part of the defaultly implemented LaTeX inventory, typesetting trees in the editor would require supporting external packages, like `tikz-qtree` which I use to make my graphics.  &#xD;&#xA;This issue would be slightly less high on my priority list than the formula stuff, but still very nice to have and certainly useful for many users here.&#xD;&#xA; - **IPA**, as already discussed [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22/how-should-we-facilitate-ipa-entry) and [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/600/better-font-for-rendering-ipa-esp-diacritics), to frequently be used in posts like [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18882/assimilation-help/18883#18883), [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18843/are-there-languages-which-require-aspiration-for-some-stops/18844#18844), [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18914/having-trouble-with-assigning-stress-degrees-to-a-long-compound/18919#18919) and many posts by other users.  &#xD;&#xA;I am aware of [IPA typeit](http://ipa.typeit.org/full/) which I used so far, and other external tools, but even with the most intelligent keyboard integration (the less I need to use the mouse, the more efficiently I can work), being able to typeset IPA symbols directly in the editor would ease asking and answering phonetics and pohnology-related questions.  &#xD;&#xA;Besides allowing for maximal flexibility and speicalised characters which no tool I have seen so far can compete with, LaTeX integration in the editor would be completely independent of devices - as much as I appreciate the effort people make to create tools like [this one](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/454/ipa-keyboard-userscript-for-you), I find it an unsatisfying solution that one needs to install an extra program to be able to properly write phonetic symbols when this would by the help of LaTeX be possible with any normal QWERTY keyboard, even from mobile devices.  &#xD;&#xA;A further convenience of having something like `tipa` included in a linguistics site would be in providing the well-known LaTeX commands that versed users are already familiar with from LaTeX being the presumably undoubted standard to typeset IPA in professional papers.  &#xD;&#xA; - Other, less urgent cases where I could imagine TeX support to be useful - again under the premise that support for special package is in general possible - would be **linguistic example formatting** (in the format *(1) (a) Peter likes fish (b) Peter likes the fish* with running numbers, proper alignment and grammaticality judgements), which I could have used [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/18911/13238), or **interlinear glosses** for posts like [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1045/thematic-roles-in-some-languages?rq=1), which are very inconvenient to do appropriately without automatic alignment; both would be possible e.g. with `covington` - although I could live with those cases being needed to be typeset externally and then included in the post via screenshots.  &#xD;&#xA;There sure are a lot of other uses for more special purposes that I considered less relevant here.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this wishlist being very long and probably not in full length equally important to everyone, I think that inclusion of simple mathematical typesetting similar as on [Math SE](http://math.stackexchange.com/) using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) would be a great and hopfully not too impossible improvement to start with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any feedback on how likely those suggestions are to be considered is appreciated!"

Most of these questions are about writing systems, unicode or IPA where there is already tags for&#xD;&#xA;   that; the rest are not really linguistic questions i.m.o.

Should we&#xD;&#xA;   delete the tag and, if necessary, change the tags of the few&#xD;&#xA;   remaining question to others? I would suggest using it in the context of semiotics, like in the question I linked, but then we should careful that it doesn't overlap with [tag:writing-systems], [tag:ipa] etc.&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:marking] - ambiguous again; both used as [tag:markedness] and [tag:morphology] - should we better restrict it to one meaning; if so, which one, or should we remove it completely and simply re-tag the existing four questions?  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:variation] - seems to be used very unhomogeneously again - what to do with it?

[tag:natural-languages] Seems a bit redundant - remove?  &#xD;&#xA;9. [tag:history] It was already discussed [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/104/what-to-do-about-the-history-tag), but without a real solution: What do we want to have this tag for? Do we refer to historical&#xD;&#xA;   linguistics (then I would rather use the&#xD;&#xA;   [tag:historical-linguistics] directly), history of linguistic theory&#xD;&#xA;   (then we should consider renaming it to &quot;history-of-linguistics&quot; or&#xD;&#xA;   &quot;history-of-theory&quot; or something) or the influence of historical context on the development of languages (but this should then again boil down to&#xD;&#xA;   [tag:historical-linguistics] or sometimes [tag:sociolinguistics])?  &#xD;&#xA;10. [tag:ancient] This is not very expressive - I would rather go with more&#xD;&#xA;   accurate tags like &quot;ancient-greek&quot; or &quot;ancient-hebrew&quot; etc.  &#xD;&#xA;11. [tag:symbol] This is used pretty unhomogeneously. Most of these questions are about writing systems, unicode or IPA where there is already tags for&#xD;&#xA;   that; the rest are not really linguistic questions i.m.o. (such as a&#xD;&#xA;   question about emoticons). The only question with a reasonable use of the&#xD;&#xA;   tag I found so far is [this&#xD;&#xA;   one](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/15561/do-symbols-include-only-morphemes),&#xD;&#xA;   but looking at the other questions tagged with this tag, &quot;symbol&quot; doesn't really help classifying questions into a more or less homogeneous group of interest which makes its need questionable. Should we&#xD;&#xA;   delete the tag and, if necessary, change the tags of the few&#xD;&#xA;   remaining question to others?&#xD;&#xA;12. [tag:marking] - ambiguous again; both used as [tag:markedness] and [tag:morphology] - should we better restrict it to one meaning; if so, which one, or should we remove it completely and simply re-tag the existing four questions?  &#xD;&#xA;13. [tag:variation] - seems to be used very unhomogeneously again - what to do with it?&#xD;&#xA;14. [tag:lexical-relations] - only three questions, one about semantics,&#xD;&#xA;   one about verbs, one about syntax - do we need it?&#xD;&#xA;15. [tag:synatx] - This is a typo&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Yes, it can be removed.&#xD;&#xA;2. Yes, they should be all synonym tags of [tag:writing-systems].&#xD;&#xA;3. Yes.&#xD;&#xA;4. Uhm, yes.&#xD;&#xA;5. Study of place names, although maybe it should be [tag:toponymy]. I think it should be at best a synonym of [tag:proper-nouns], since this is also the main tag I proposed for [tag:proper-names].  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: If we make it synonyms, does this make sure that questions tagged [tag:proper-names] don't somewhere show up as [tag:toponymy]?*&#xD;&#xA;6. It sounds like a meta-tag, but I'm not sure, so I may leave it for the time being.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: It is a meta-tag, but used pretty often (5 times already only this month) so I would definitely keep it, just thuoght a more intuitive name would help new users use it.*  &#xD;&#xA;7. [tag:language-identification] questions may be kept (not sure we ruled on them being banned in all cases), but I'd be strongly in favor of setting restrictions on how to handle them. In case these already exist, upgrade them.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: I don't think existing questions should be deleted either, but maybe to prevent new questions (it's alreay said in the help center, but when users see that a tag exists they might think such questions are still okay) we could place an information to the tag wiki?*  &#xD;&#xA;8. Yes, should be removed. We already have [tag:constructed-languages] to distinguish. Linguistics is primarily about natural languages anyway.&#xD;&#xA;9. I may agree with Aaron's proposal [tag:historical-context]. It sounds like a nice substitute for [tag:history] which seems very vague.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: Yes, this sounds good.*&#xD;&#xA;10. Agreed. It should be removed in favor of more specific tags, like the ones you suggested.  &#xD;&#xA;11. Not sure about deleting it, but it needs to be seen how it could be used. The concept of symbols is not all external to Linguistics.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: I would suggest using it in the context of semiotics, like in the question I linked, but then we should careful that it doesn't overlap with [tag:writing-systems], [tag:ipa] etc.*&#xD;&#xA;12. The linguistic term is [tag:markedness], so we should delete [tag:marking]. It's also redundant.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: The tag is not always used in the sense of markedness, some uses are about moprhological marking. But it's only four questions in total anyway, so we could just re-tag them.*&#xD;&#xA;13. We should write a decent tag wiki to describe how to properly use it, but as a concept it is valid, so we should keep it.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: So we should stick to a use in the sense of language variation (like dialects or sociolects)?*&#xD;&#xA;14. Lexical semantics is a subfield of semantics, so maybe this one might be redundant. But it's a tricky one because the concept it encompasses is huge.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: Since it has only been used three times in total, I think it's no problem to delete it despite it being a subfield of another field. If we want to keep it, we should go with a good tag wiki or at least a better name (like &quot;lexical-semantics&quot;), because &quot;lexical-relations&quot; is a bit vague.*&#xD;&#xA;15. Remove, of course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Synonym tags&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Agree &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:vocabulary] - [tag:lexicon]  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:word-classes] - **[tag:parts-of-speech]**&#xD;&#xA; - **[tag:constructed-language]** - [tag:conlang]&#xD;&#xA; - **[tag:grammatical-number]** - &lt;s&gt;[tag:number]&lt;/s&gt; (not used)&#xD;&#xA; - &lt;s&gt;[tag:origin-of-language]&lt;/s&gt; (not very useful) - **[tag:evolutionary-linguistics]** &#xD;&#xA; - &lt;s&gt;[tag:discourse]&lt;/s&gt; (doesn't seem useful) - [tag:discourse-analysis]&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:stops] - [tag:plosives]  &#xD;&#xA; - **[tag:proper-nouns]** - [tag:proper-names] - [tag:names]&#xD;&#xA; - &lt;s&gt;[tag:diachronic]&lt;/s&gt; (redundant) - **[tag:historical-linguistics]** or [tag:language-change] &#xD;&#xA; - **[tag:constituency]** - [tag:constituents] &#xD;&#xA; - **[tag:annotated-data]** - [tag:annotation]  &#xD;&#xA; - &lt;s&gt;[tag:tools]&lt;/s&gt; - [tag:nlp] (or [tag:computational-linguistics])&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:slavic] - **[tag:slavic-languages]** (former used only in two questions)&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;## Disagree&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  &#xD;&#xA; - &lt;s&gt;[tag:computer-science]&lt;/s&gt; (doesn't seem useful)  &#xD;&#xA;[tag:computational-linguistic] - [tag:nlp] (Not synonyms. Computational linguistics ***is not*** nlp)  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: I am aware that they are actually not synonymous, but we already defined them as tag synonyms - see [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/571/13238). So should we delete [tag:computer-science] and leave the other two as-is?*  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:morphemes] - [tag:morphology] (one is the subject study of the other)  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: Again, I know they are not identical by definition, but as for the use on this site, in which question context couldn't both of the tags be used?*  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:thematic-roles] - [tag:theta-role] (thematic roles may refer to theta role, but also to thematic relations, so while the two tags refer to expressions that are sometimes used interchangeably, [they can be distinguished][1].)  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: Again, the question is whether they will actually be used diferently. But okay, let's keep that one like this.*&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:software] - [tag:nlp] (not the same area)   &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: So far, all of the software-tagged questions are about NLP tools. But skimming through the questions, possibly the difference is that the former is usually rather requests for existing tools, while the latter is used for problems in creating NLP software? If so, I'd be okay with leaving them separately, but then we should be more specific about theird intended usage in the tag wikis.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Unsure/Other&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [tag:resources] - [tag:resource-request] - [tag:online-resources] - [tag:reference-request] - [tag:references]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd keep [tag:reference-request], although I'm not sure they're synonyms with [tag:resource-request], since the former is about documentation, papers, essays and so on, while the latter is about raw material (corpora, etc).  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: That distinction seems useful. If we write proper wikis, we could divide them accordingly.*&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  [tag:writing] - [tag:writing-systems] - [tag:written-language]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not very sure about this. The first and third could be synonyms but they overlap with the second one, at times.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: Yes, that's a bit difficult. Let's wait for some more opinions maybe.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [tag:meaning] - [tag:semantics]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;May agree with this, but I'm not sure meaning is always used in this way. Maybe it could be deleted, seems like a redundant tag.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: I guess most of the time it is used in this way, in the other contexts it was wrong anyway. So I'd be in favour of either merging it with semantics or deleting it and, if necessary, re-tag existing questions.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [tag:dependency] - [tag:dependency-grammar] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not sure how to tackle these, but I may agree on making them synonyms if it is shown they are always used as such on the site.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: Where are they not used interchangeably on this site?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_role#Theta_roles_and_thematic_relations" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Alenanno nicely asked that I please post it here, too, so here ya go.  Three things that probably need fixing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Feel free to edit this main posting to adjust for non-English-specific tools.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We already have lists of general-reference resources, [one on meta](https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2573) and [a larger one on main](http://english.stackexchange.com/q/1482). For the most part, these are things like dictionaries and thesauri, not actual tools related to natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics (CL). I would like to assemble a list of the most useful tools that come in handy for ELU.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These range from simple two-edged swords like Google Ngrams and the fancier corpus-analytic tools like the BNC or COCA (both of which require some sophistication to use), all the way up to tools for doing part-of-speech (POS) assignments, as well as stemmers, lemmatizers, chunkers, and syntactic analysers (‘parsers’).   There are a lot of other interesting ELU-related things it would be nice to know where to find the tools for, too. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, given this sentence:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Yes of course the car whose headlights were off was running is right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One can use the **CMU Link Grammar Parser** via [the CGI form here](http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/submit-sentence-4.html) to generate this parse:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    (S Yes&#xD;&#xA;       (S (PP of course)&#xD;&#xA;          (S (NP (NP the car)&#xD;&#xA;                 (SBAR (WHNP whose headlights)&#xD;&#xA;                       (S (VP were&#xD;&#xA;                              (PRT off)))))&#xD;&#xA;             (VP was&#xD;&#xA;                 (VP running is&#xD;&#xA;                     (ADVP right)))))&#xD;&#xA;       .)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, another approach is to use the [**DependenSee visualization tool**](http://chaoticity.com/dependensee-a-dependency-parse-visualisation-tool/) to generate a PNG of the dependency graph of a given sentence using the [**Stanford Parser**](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml), which looks like this for that same sentence:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![dependency graph of sample sentence][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please add a separate answer for each tool, and include both the link and a small demo of what that tool is good for.  I find the graphical tools especially useful, and I think a lot of other people do, too: witness the fascination with Google N-grams. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; We can use the voting system as a way of showing which tools we think are most or least useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/3nvZU.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Who are the diamond moderators? How many are there?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We currently have 3 diamond moderators on Linguistics.SE. They are (in no particular order):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Alenanno][1]][2] [![Louis Rhys][3]][4][![Otavio Macedo][5]][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also view [a full list of diamond moderators][7] on *all* of the Stack Exchange sites in the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to these community members, members of the Stack Exchange, Inc. team that keeps these sites running have the option to carry diamonds on any site. You can find a list of the team members on [Stack Exchange's team page][8].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 2. What is the job of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are regular members of the community that have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help ensure that the community's issues are properly and promptly addressed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Diamond moderators essentially serve as human &quot;exception handlers&quot;][9]. In addition to the efforts of other users who have earned moderation privileges, diamond moderators will also step in to help keep the site in order. Most of the time, moderators respond to [flags from community members][10].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All diamond moderators must accept the [moderator agreement][11], which essentially states that they must only use their abilities (including access to confidential information) for the good of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 3. What special privileges do diamond moderators have?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - They have access to all the abilities of [trusted users][12], regardless of their reputation.&#xD;&#xA; - Their votes are binding. Any place where users with sufficient privileges can vote—close, open, delete, undelete, spam/offensive, migration, etc.—a diamond moderator's vote is binding and the action takes effect immediately.&#xD;&#xA; - They can lock posts. Locked posts cannot be voted on, commented, or changed in any way.&#xD;&#xA; - They can protect questions. Protected questions cannot be answered by anonymous and very new users, and are used to help keep down spam.&#xD;&#xA; - They can see more data in the system, including general vote statistics (but not specific voting information for individual users or posts) and user profile information.&#xD;&#xA; - They can view all deleted posts on an individual user's profile.&#xD;&#xA; - They can place users in [timed suspension][13], and delete user accounts if necessary.&#xD;&#xA; - They can perform large-scale maintenance actions such as merging questions and tags, tag synonym approvals, question migration to any other site in the network, and so forth.&#xD;&#xA; - They can apply special moderator-only tags on the meta site, which appear in red.&#xD;&#xA; - They can convert a post into &quot;Community Wiki&quot; status, or convert an answer into a comment.&#xD;&#xA; - They can (at their discretion) refund and cancel a bounty.&#xD;&#xA; - They can merge user accounts when requested.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 4. How do we get the attention of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of ways. **The most common way is to [flag the offending post][14] for attention**. Flags show up in a special queue that is visible only to moderators. This is one of the primary ways that you help us improve the site, so **any time you see something bad happening, please use your flags!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that in addition to the canned or stock reasons that appear in the mod flag dialog, **you can also select the &quot;other&quot; option and type a custom message**. This is useful for unusual cases where, for example, you want to report a systemic problem with a particular user. Since you can only flag posts (and not users), just pick one of their posts and explain the problem in a custom flag message.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But please **remember that not all flags are acted upon**! It is up to the discretion of the moderator who processes your flag whether they will take the action you suggest. There are essentially three options: they might agree with your flag and do precisely as you suggest, they might agree with your flag but think some other intervention is indicated, or they might disagree with your flag and think no action is warranted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The decisions made on flags that you have raised are visible in your flagging summary. To view that, click on the number displayed next to the &quot;helpful flags&quot; field in your user profile. Don't let it get you down if a few of your flags are marked &quot;declined&quot;. That's just our way of keeping track of the actions that we take. You only need to be worried that you might be doing something wrong if the *majority* of your flags have been declined (as opposed to marked as &quot;helpful&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to contact a moderator is to **post a question here on the Meta site**. This is likely to be overkill for most purposes, and is mainly used when you want to seek the opinion of the larger community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that **while moderator flags are private, posts on Meta are public**. Therefore, if you might be disclosing sensitive information or making inflammatory accusations against other users, you should probably limit yourself to raising a flag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 5. How are the diamond moderators chosen? Can I become one?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current set of moderators are [*pro tempore* moderators][15]; that is to say, they are not elected, but rather [picked and appointed by Stack Exchange staff members][16].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the usual practice prior to a site graduating from public beta, as there are often not yet enough established community members to [vote in an election][17].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until the site officially launches and a community-wide election is held, there is no mechanism in place for appointing new moderators. In the mean time, you can help improve the site (and help out the diamond moderators) by [earning and exercising moderation privileges][18]. You earn privileges by gaining reputation—in other words, by contributing high-quality questions and answers!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 6. What can I do if I disagree with the action(s) taken by a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators are only human, and *they do make mistakes*! If you think we've made an error in responding to one of your flags, **the easiest thing to do is re-flag the post again**. The second time around, it's probably best to use the &quot;other&quot; field to provide a custom comment that explains your rationale a bit more clearly—we probably just didn't catch onto your concerns the first time around. You can also use this field to ask a *specific* moderator to process your flag, in the unlikely event that you think that one is biased against your concerns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's something a bit more complicated/subjective (perhaps something that would be better discussed by the community at large), or you've already flagged it twice, then **you should post a question about it here on Meta**. Remember to include *all relevant information* in your question, such as a link to the post in question and your exact concerns. The other moderators and community members who didn't/can't see your flag need to know what you're talking about in order to adequately discuss your concerns. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the unlikely event that you're *still* not happy, even after bringing the issue to Meta and soliciting the opinion of the larger community, then **you have one final recourse: you can escalate the issue to the moderators' bosses**. Community moderators are held accountable to and by the Stack Exchange staff. Therefore, if you truly believe that a moderator has abused his/her privileges, you can send an email to **team+linguistics@stackexchange.com**, or alternatively you can post a question on the [global Meta site for the entire Stack Exchange network][19]. But you really do need to discuss it *here* on the Linguistics Meta first. If you skip that step, your complaints elsewhere are less likely to be taken seriously and you may simply end up being pointed here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to Cody Gray for the elaboration of this answer: [Philosophy SE][20].&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TGTzY.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/111/alenanno&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/flair/92.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/92/louis-rhys&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKwNi.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/22/otavio-macedo&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://stackexchange.com/about/moderators&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://stackexchange.com/about/team&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges/trusted-user&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/200/111&#xD;&#xA;  [17]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/&#xD;&#xA;  [18]: http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges&#xD;&#xA;  [19]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [20]: https://philosophy.meta.stackexchange.com/a/374/1768" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

What the Heck?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see from my answers, this is a linguistics question.  Linguists such as M. Kilgariff have asked it, long since.  And they have answered it too, generally to the effect that a Google Web Search &quot;hit count&quot; isn't the right tool for the job for a lot of reasons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But it's also a fair bet that had that question been asked here it would have been objected to by people who entirely missed the &quot;try and get a quick sense of which term is more widely used&quot; in the question.  This is someone who is doing a little bit of linguistic research on a couple of phrases, and wondering why the tool that xe is using is providing nonsense answers, and whether it's even the right tool to be using.  But it's possible to miss that and mis-read this as a question about how Google works rather than as a question about whether Google can be used as a tool for linguistic analysis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So how would you have phrased this question for this readership of &quot;professional linguists&quot;?

A similar request was already made on meta [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1662/feature-request-let-us-easily-write-in-ipa-and-tree-diagrams).  &#xD;&#xA;This is where I don't know for sure what is technically possible: Since trees are not part of the defaultly implemented LaTeX inventory, typesetting trees in the editor would require supporting external packages, like `tikz-qtree` which I use to make my graphics.  &#xD;&#xA;This issue would be slightly less high on my priority list than the formula stuff, but still very nice to have and certainly useful for many users here.&#xD;&#xA; - **IPA**, as already discussed [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22/how-should-we-facilitate-ipa-entry) and [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/600/better-font-for-rendering-ipa-esp-diacritics), to frequently be used in posts like [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18882/assimilation-help/18883#18883), [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18843/are-there-languages-which-require-aspiration-for-some-stops/18844#18844), [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18914/having-trouble-with-assigning-stress-degrees-to-a-long-compound/18919#18919) and many posts by other users.  &#xD;&#xA;I am aware of [IPA typeit](http://ipa.typeit.org/full/) which I used so far, and other external tools, but even with the most intelligent keyboard integration (the less I need to use the mouse, the more efficiently I can work), being able to typeset IPA symbols directly in the editor would ease asking and answering phonetics and pohnology-related questions.  &#xD;&#xA;Besides allowing for maximal flexibility and speicalised characters which no tool I have seen so far can compete with, LaTeX integration in the editor would be completely independent of devices - as much as I appreciate the effort people make to create tools like [this one](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/454/ipa-keyboard-userscript-for-you), I find it an unsatisfying solution that one needs to install an extra program to be able to properly write phonetic symbols when this would by the help of LaTeX be possible with any normal QWERTY keyboard, even from mobile devices.  &#xD;&#xA;A further convenience of having something like `tipa` included in a linguistics site would be in providing the well-known LaTeX commands that versed users are already familiar with from LaTeX being the presumably undoubted standard to typeset IPA in professional papers.  &#xD;&#xA; - Other, less urgent cases where I could imagine TeX support to be useful - again under the premise that support for special package is in general possible - would be **linguistic example formatting** (in the format *(1) (a) Peter likes fish (b) Peter likes the fish* with running numbers, proper alignment and grammaticality judgements), which I could have used [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/18911/13238), or **interlinear glosses** for posts like [here](http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1045/thematic-roles-in-some-languages?rq=1), which are very inconvenient to do appropriately without automatic alignment; both would be possible e.g. with `covington` - although I could live with those cases being needed to be typeset externally and then included in the post via screenshots.  &#xD;&#xA;There sure are a lot of other uses for more special purposes that I considered less relevant here.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this wishlist being very long and probably not in full length equally important to everyone, I think that inclusion of simple mathematical typesetting similar as on [Math SE](https://math.stackexchange.com/) using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) would be a great and hopfully not too impossible improvement to start with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any feedback on how likely those suggestions are to be considered is appreciated!"

So to my mind the issue of how to get Unicode-encoded IPA symbols into questions and answers seems to be adequately addressed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is inadequate, to my mind, is the typography of IPA characters on the site. It was [suggested here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/35/1616) that IPA be rendered using the existing `code formatting` mechanism (surrounding all IPA text with backticks), and instinctively that is what I had been doing anyway, even before seeing that suggestion. It works well for isolated glyphs, but is pretty terrible even for the most common diacritics. For example: `ã` (nasalization), `a̰` (creaky phonation), `ḁ` (devoicing), `a̤` (breathy phonation), `t̪` (dental). It's even worse when you try to use multiple diacritics, e.g.ː `n̠̥` (retracted + devoiced).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this issue can be solved by changing the style sheet for Linguistics SE, so that either:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. text enclosed in backticks is rendered with the [Doulos SIL webfont](http://scripts.sil.org/doulossil_download) or a similarly capable typeface, or&#xD;&#xA;2. text *not* enclosed in backticks is rendered with the [Charis SIL webfont](http://scripts.sil.org/charissil_download) (Charis because it has bold, italic, and bold+italic faces, so it can handle the markdown formatting).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If option 2 is chosen, then obviously the convention would be to *not* use backticks for IPA text, in which case it could optionally be delimited in the usual ways (i.e., [square brackets] for phonetic transcriptions, /slash brackets/ for phonemic transcriptions, &amp;lt;angle brackets&amp;gt; for explicit reference to a glyph and/or its orthographic use).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a screenshot of what I see on Firefox 37.0.1 on Linux:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Screenshot of diacritic rendering][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a second screenshot of diacritics in one of the comments (with a little shading added to make more clear the relevant parts):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Another screenshot of diacritic rendering][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Presumably that devoicing ring is supposed to be on the final `a`, not on the `e` in &quot;etc&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ny3XU.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4UDwG.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There are a lot of other interesting ELU-related things it would be nice to know where to find the tools for, too. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, given this sentence:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Yes of course the car whose headlights were off was running is right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One can use the **CMU Link Grammar Parser** via [the CGI form here](http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/submit-sentence-4.html) to generate this parse:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    (S Yes&#xD;&#xA;       (S (PP of course)&#xD;&#xA;          (S (NP (NP the car)&#xD;&#xA;                 (SBAR (WHNP whose headlights)&#xD;&#xA;                       (S (VP were&#xD;&#xA;                              (PRT off)))))&#xD;&#xA;             (VP was&#xD;&#xA;                 (VP running is&#xD;&#xA;                     (ADVP right)))))&#xD;&#xA;       .)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, another approach is to use the [**DependenSee visualization tool**](http://chaoticity.com/dependensee-a-dependency-parse-visualisation-tool/) to generate a PNG of the dependency graph of a given sentence using the [**Stanford Parser**](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml), which looks like this for that same sentence:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![dependency graph of sample sentence][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please add a separate answer for each tool, and include both the link and a small demo of what that tool is good for.

It is not relevant to the current sociology of the discipline.  Much as some academics would prefer that their view be given exclusive appreciation, linguistics today is a big tent which encompasses a variety of theoretical approaches.  Furthermore, it is becoming more rather than less allied with disciplines like computer science, psychology, evolutionary biology (etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will admit to being biased by my background – that of a graduate student at an institution (Penn) where the culture is heavily biases towards cooperation across disciplinary boundaries as well as traditional rifts such as those evoked by the term &quot;Linguistics Wars.&quot;  Chomsky and Labov (widely regarded as being generals of two warring armies) gave the two keynotes at a conference here last year.  Chomsky was a little down on (of all things) computational linguistics, and a few computational linguists [replied][1].  This is far from a war, however, and I think that a large majority of professional linguists would concur in that view.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question could be re-asked constructively as (e.g.) &quot;what are current trends in linguistics research?&quot;  (Edit: which I see Mitch suggested as an alternate formulation in the comments for the linked question; I probably inadvertently calqued my suggestion from his.)  There are interesting things to be said about this (new trends in computational linguistics, the &quot;experimental syntax&quot; movement, large-scale analysis of sociolinguistic data via social media...).  But this is a *fundamentally different* question than the one linked, especially given the bulleted lists which tend to canalize rather than stimulate discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Side note: there are non-single-answer questions that I do think are appropriate, like [this one][2] and [this one][3].

I indicated as much when I posed the second one, giving my reasons for &quot;re-asking&quot; it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the disagreement whether constructed languages would be considered on-topic here &amp;mdash; and given that I am interested in a wide-spread writing system which I would consider to be only ambiguously a constructed language (despite the fact that it has no form other than the written form!) &amp;mdash; I had hoped to get clarification of whether it would be on topic by asking a question about languages generally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best *short* piece of terminology for this seemed at the time to be &quot;natural language&quot;, in view of the description of how ASL (a partially designed langauge) came to be regarded as &quot;natural&quot;, according to Wikipedia. However, a number of the responses and commentators seemed to get stuck on the entirely reasonable interpretation of &quot;natural&quot; as being the antonym of &quot;artificial&quot; or &quot;constructed&quot;, which seems to me to refer to the historical origin of a language rather than any linguistic feature of the language. So I asked the second question, using alternative terminology (which seemed both reasonable, and which I clarified in my question), in order to try and re-start the discussion and keep it clear of the confusion produced by the first, which had garnered answers pertinent only to the original phrasing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was afterwards (impatiently) directed by Alek Strom to revise the original question to better suit my intent, which I did; and later still Rebecca Chernoff went a step further and simply reverted the revisions that I had been directed to make to the original question, noting that I should never have edited it to change its scope so much, which had been my original feeling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is clearly a point on which this SE site can use clarification. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In cases such as these, when someone asks a question which people misinterpret (for completely understandable reasons) and give good answers to (which one may regard as being quite literally correct), but which fails to answer the intended question, is it better to revise the original question to clarify the intent, or simply ask a new question?"

Given that, I think we should think of when having a separate [tag:cross-linguistic] tag will be useful for the community; I propose the following guideline:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The cross-linguistic tag is for questions that specifically ask for comparisons across (as opposed to within) languages or language families.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So a question about a phenomenon in one language would not carry this tag, even though its answers could of course make reference to other languages.  More subtly, a (hypothetically existing) question about the development of periphrastic verb paradigms in Romance would not bear this tag, since it is about *one* process in the Romance family.  A question asking to compare/contrast Romance and Germanic periphrastic tenses would have the tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of the questions currently tagged cross-linguistic, I think only https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/449/is-the-ll-in-albanian-like-the-sounds-in-other-languages and https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/378/are-there-languages-with-other-spatial-deixis-besides-here-there-and-over-t meet this criterion.

Given the vastness of the Internet, it is madness to attempt to define ourselves relationally with respect to it.  Even within the SX microcosm, that isn't how things should work.  For a community to form, there needs to be something internal that makes it cohere; we can't just be the residue that other language-related SX sites don't soak up.  (This is the same reason why we ought to accept linguistically informed questions about English, even though there is an English Language SX.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This site is about theoretical lingusitics.  A question about the etymology of one word in one language is not within our scope since it has no way of linking up to a broader theory.  Maybe the word was inherited, borrowed, invented, etc., but that fact is a historical accident no bearing on any other aspect of the language or languages in general.  Etymology questions can be theoretical, but they have to ask not just for the history of a single word, but rather an explanation of the behavior of a class of words, a clade of languages, a particular sound change, etc." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If I happen to know two more languages with the relevant feature, I'm not going to pass over the question because my list would be shorter and therefore somehow inferior. And I'm also not going to repeat the original three languages in my own answer alongside the additional two in an attempt to create a more comprehensive super-list of five languages! I'm simply going to add my answer with the two languages that I have, trusting that **this is a &quot;the more the merrier&quot; type of situation**. This was precisely what I did in [this situation][1], where the two people who had responded before me had provided perfectly acceptable answers but I happened to think of a couple of additional examples that I thought were worth sharing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for how to handle upvoting, one sensible way to approach upvoting on answers to &quot;list&quot; questions is simply to **upvote every answer that fulfills the criteria sought out in the question**. It wouldn't be a matter of picking the *best* answer but rather acknowledging *every accurate* answer, thereby rewarding each person who responded with helpful information for making a valuable contribution. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Incidentally, I believe this may currently be disallowed, but I think it would be great if whoever asked the original question could accept more than one answer as &quot;the correct answer&quot; (this may actually be a topic worthy of its own question here in Meta!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/653/is-there-any-language-that-observe-root-changes-in-response-to-the-addition-of-a/723#723" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The body of the question is what tells us the &quot;situation&quot; for the question, (e.g. where the OP got that doubt from?) and helps us to understand what the OP is looking for. &#xD;&#xA; 4. **It was asking too many things**: Now, a question with 2 or 3 related questions to the main one might be ok, but here there were too many issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Too many points (I'm not sure I forgot something) which inevitably make it hard to edit the question in order to save it, unless we totally rephrase it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question even if closed, can still be edited and reopened.

If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why do we close a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask][1] section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions belong elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is closing like deletion?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What are the requirements for closing a question?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have 500 reputation on the site currently, or 3000 reputation on a graduated site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How are moderators different?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Initially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ok, so how does it work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Example close button][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close vote reasons dialog][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Other votes][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&#xD;&#xA; * The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.&#xD;&#xA; * The other options are straight out closes.&#xD;&#xA; * Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&#xD;&#xA; * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&#xD;&#xA; * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close banner][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How does vote to re-open work?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Re-open link][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What happens if I make a mistake?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually there are two tools for this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * [Review][7]. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes. You are then free to look at the question and decide if you agree.&#xD;&#xA; * [Tools][8]. Commonly referred to as the &quot;10k tools&quot;, this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page. Here, you can see questions that might have been closed incorrectly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/review&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/tools" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

You don't need to ask a question with **one answer**, but asking for too much is not OK, either. Some issues about this are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - How do we handle them? They need constant attention, fixing new users' answers, etc. This is not part of Moderator duties, so this is the first problem.&#xD;&#xA; - Turn them to CW? Community Wikis are not the answer to any question that doesn't fit the site. Community Wikis are for those questions that don't fit the site but represent **a special case**. If we do this for any open-ended list, then we're not dealing with special cases anymore.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if you ask for a feature shared by languages which are just a few, then it could be fine.

They are Q&amp;A sites, so they expect to bring a reasonably narrow set of information for a certain question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have more than one issue, why not simply posting multiple questions that address each issue? If your question is addressing a huge issue, why can't you word it to make it more narrow?

Protected questions cannot be answered by anonymous and very new users, and are used to help keep down spam.&#xD;&#xA; - They can see more data in the system, including general vote statistics (but not specific voting information for individual users or posts) and user profile information.&#xD;&#xA; - They can view all deleted posts on an individual user's profile.&#xD;&#xA; - They can place users in [timed suspension][13], and delete user accounts if necessary.&#xD;&#xA; - They can perform large-scale maintenance actions such as merging questions and tags, tag synonym approvals, question migration to any other site in the network, and so forth.&#xD;&#xA; - They can apply special moderator-only tags on the meta site, which appear in red.&#xD;&#xA; - They can convert a post into &quot;Community Wiki&quot; status, or convert an answer into a comment.&#xD;&#xA; - They can (at their discretion) refund and cancel a bounty.&#xD;&#xA; - They can merge user accounts when requested.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 4. How do we get the attention of a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of ways. **The most common way is to [flag the offending post][14] for attention**. Flags show up in a special queue that is visible only to moderators. This is one of the primary ways that you help us improve the site, so **any time you see something bad happening, please use your flags!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that in addition to the canned or stock reasons that appear in the mod flag dialog, **you can also select the &quot;other&quot; option and type a custom message**. This is useful for unusual cases where, for example, you want to report a systemic problem with a particular user. Since you can only flag posts (and not users), just pick one of their posts and explain the problem in a custom flag message.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But please **remember that not all flags are acted upon**! It is up to the discretion of the moderator who processes your flag whether they will take the action you suggest. There are essentially three options: they might agree with your flag and do precisely as you suggest, they might agree with your flag but think some other intervention is indicated, or they might disagree with your flag and think no action is warranted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The decisions made on flags that you have raised are visible in your flagging summary. To view that, click on the number displayed next to the &quot;helpful flags&quot; field in your user profile. Don't let it get you down if a few of your flags are marked &quot;declined&quot;. That's just our way of keeping track of the actions that we take. You only need to be worried that you might be doing something wrong if the *majority* of your flags have been declined (as opposed to marked as &quot;helpful&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to contact a moderator is to **post a question here on the Meta site**. This is likely to be overkill for most purposes, and is mainly used when you want to seek the opinion of the larger community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that **while moderator flags are private, posts on Meta are public**. Therefore, if you might be disclosing sensitive information or making inflammatory accusations against other users, you should probably limit yourself to raising a flag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 5. How are the diamond moderators chosen? Can I become one?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current set of moderators are [*pro tempore* moderators][15]; that is to say, they are not elected, but rather [picked and appointed by Stack Exchange staff members][16].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the usual practice prior to a site graduating from public beta, as there are often not yet enough established community members to [vote in an election][17].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until the site officially launches and a community-wide election is held, there is no mechanism in place for appointing new moderators. In the mean time, you can help improve the site (and help out the diamond moderators) by [earning and exercising moderation privileges][18]. You earn privileges by gaining reputation—in other words, by contributing high-quality questions and answers!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 6. What can I do if I disagree with the action(s) taken by a diamond moderator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators are only human, and *they do make mistakes*! If you think we've made an error in responding to one of your flags, **the easiest thing to do is re-flag the post again**. The second time around, it's probably best to use the &quot;other&quot; field to provide a custom comment that explains your rationale a bit more clearly—we probably just didn't catch onto your concerns the first time around. You can also use this field to ask a *specific* moderator to process your flag, in the unlikely event that you think that one is biased against your concerns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's something a bit more complicated/subjective (perhaps something that would be better discussed by the community at large), or you've already flagged it twice, then **you should post a question about it here on Meta**. Remember to include *all relevant information* in your question, such as a link to the post in question and your exact concerns. The other moderators and community members who didn't/can't see your flag need to know what you're talking about in order to adequately discuss your concerns. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the unlikely event that you're *still* not happy, even after bringing the issue to Meta and soliciting the opinion of the larger community, then **you have one final recourse: you can escalate the issue to the moderators' bosses**. Community moderators are held accountable to and by the Stack Exchange staff. Therefore, if you truly believe that a moderator has abused his/her privileges, you can send an email to **team+linguistics@stackexchange.com**, or alternatively you can post a question on the [global Meta site for the entire Stack Exchange network][19]. But you really do need to discuss it *here* on the Linguistics Meta first. If you skip that step, your complaints elsewhere are less likely to be taken seriously and you may simply end up being pointed here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to Cody Gray for the elaboration of this answer: [Philosophy SE][20].&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/TGTzY.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/111/alenanno&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/flair/92.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/92/louis-rhys&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKwNi.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/22/otavio-macedo&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://stackexchange.com/about/moderators&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://stackexchange.com/about/team&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges/trusted-user&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/200/111&#xD;&#xA;  [17]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/&#xD;&#xA;  [18]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges&#xD;&#xA;  [19]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [20]: https://philosophy.meta.stackexchange.com/a/374/1768" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I'm inspired by a recent [tree question][1], where the post proposes a tree and asks for specific correction (what &quot;to&quot; is). The question does not literally request people to make a tree, but it could be seen as a variant of such a request (such questions are sometimes closed, e.g. [&quot;Lucy reported that scientists wonder if the medicine will work&quot;][2]). The above-mentioned reasons are half about title problems, and I don't understand what the real issue is there. The statement *There's no intuitive way to title them so they all end up as variations of &quot;Syntax tree problem&quot;* is ambiguous. Does that mean &quot;title them in such a way that they...&quot;, or &quot;title them, and therefore they...&quot;. There's an underlying presupposition about titles that I'm not getting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main feature of tree-drawing questions which I find most useless is something that extends to various other questions not even about syntax, namely the class of &quot;please do my homework&quot; questions. That class of questions seem to really meet the objection of there being little chance that the question will ever help anyone but the OP, and it seems to me that &quot;do my homework&quot; questions themselves should be banned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me that the third objection is a particularly relevant one, but it should be more general and also more explicit. In the case of &quot;Lucy reported&quot;, there is no discernable general question, whereas in the question about the infinitive complementizer, there is, and the questions could even have been phrased as &quot;what label immediately dominates infinitival 'to'?&quot;. Thus, on-topic questions should transparently generalize to some class of linguistic phenomena.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, closing vs. not closing questions about syntax trees depends on how some number of readers feel about a question, and the [&quot;Ginny thinks Harry is dreamy&quot;][3] question does in my opinion satisfy the desideratum of generality (it asks about the status of be-Adj phrases and whether be is a &quot;verb&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My reason for posting this answer is to try to create a bit more guidance for posters, so that people will better understand what kinds of questions to not post, and why.

There is a specific point about the [&quot;Not 'Please make me a tree'&quot;][1] rule which I raise in my answer, the gist of which being that I don't think it is clear enough what constitutes a what-not-to-do. It was suggested that I raise the broader question. I find the guidance a bit too minimal, especially in terms of giving functional explanations for the guidelines that would allow users to better filter and frame their questions. My underlying assumption is that people will better understand what to do if they know why that's what they should do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One question is whether &quot;do my homework for me&quot; questions should be allowed. IMO, they should not be: and we should say so. However, there is nothing in the help center ([about][2], [on-topic][3], [dont-ask][4]) that suggests that this place *isn't* among other things a free answer-giving service. On-topic starts by saying who LSE is for, but not what purpose it serves. This was pointed out as the second point in [this][5] meta-discussion. The off-topic list stipulates that syntax trees, translation, and foreign-language learning help are out, but no reason is given (it also fails to include &quot;language identification&quot; questions). I would exclude such questions as having no general value -- knowing that Իմ անկյուն ցավում է is Armenian or that it means &quot;My elbow hurts&quot; is not a fact which can be applied to any other scientific linguistic inquiry. IMO, a question should be about something conceptual and general. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a discussion of homework questions [here][6], and I don't see any support for answering people's homeworks for them. Some of the points raised in that discussion are that questions about homeworks should show signs of &quot;making an effort&quot;, and that in principle, such questions might indirectly point to a question of general interest, so &quot;How do you draw 'I want to go home'?&quot; might lead to a question whether &quot;go home&quot; is a VP, but it also might lead to a question about S dominating &quot;to go home&quot;. Might in principle, eventually, but doesn't, when framed as &quot;How do you draw this tree&quot; (there are analogous issues in phonology, morphology, historical etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe that we should explicitly say &quot;Do not ask us to do your homework for you&quot;, while admiting that homeworks can *lead to* appropriate questions. Then we should relate homeworks to what a good question is, specifically saying something to the effect that in answering a homework, you may discover that you don't know a specific think about the problem, like you don't know how to employ the concepts &quot;phoneme&quot; versus &quot;contrast&quot; in your answer, and this leads to a more general question -- the question that you should ask -- of what the difference is between these concepts. This would be a good (enough) question because the answer applies to any number of specific instances. We should relate homeworks to the desideratum of &quot;showing some effort&quot;, saying something like &quot;explain what part you *do* understand, and what alternatives you are considering&quot;, though I would frame this in terms of providing context, to which we should add &quot;Make clear your framework assumptions&quot;, since analysis questions have many answers, depending on whether you're doing Categorial Grammar, Minimalism, Classical Aspects (anybody??), HPSG, LFG, or whatever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So my suggestion is that we need some higher-level (help center) identification of the purpose of the site, and some elaboration of why asking for homework answers, translations and language identification is contrary to that purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;{ADDENDUM}&#xD;&#xA;[Here][7] is a recent example of someone asking for a solution to a phonology problem, and an exemplar of what should be off topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/529/should-we-make-questions-about-specific-syntax-trees-off-topic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/tour&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/209/about-questions-salvaging&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/313/is-it-a-good-idea-to-encourage-answering-home-work-questions&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/11323/determining-underlying-representation" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Preventing people from posting answers to closed or on-hold questions helps prevent this from happening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To protect the original poster from being misled**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you answer an unclear question, the OP may think they got what they were looking for, while they actually still have a misunderstanding that nobody was able to address. This being the case, we’d like to encourage the original poster to clarify the question before an answer is posted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Closing a question can send a signal to the OP that they have to communicate what they’re looking for more clearly, and keep paying attention to comments asking for clarification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The /ɔ/ question: my overly-pessimistic, worst-case scenario**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here][1]'s the specific question that seems to be relevant. The problem I have with this question is that it’s not clear about what its purpose is, which I feel is vital for a list question. Since a complete answer is impossible (we can’t list all the words with /ɔ/), we need to know criteria for judging which answers are the most useful for the OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, any answer will have to deal with dialects, since this is something that varies dialectically. But we don’t actually know that the main question is about dialectology. That is only one interpretation of the question. It might actually be about phonetics. The question uses phonemic slashes, true; but it refers to the &quot;/ɔ/ vowel sound&quot; as well as using the symbol &quot;/o/,&quot; which is ambiguous in the context of dialectology, and referring to &quot;open back&quot; counterparts of this vowel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here’s a possible “worst-case scenario” where the questioner doesn’t actually care about dialectology: imagine a person is learning Italian, which has contrastive /o/ and /ɔ/, and wants to learn how to pronounce /ɔ/. This person decides to look for example words in English with [ɔ] to help them learn the vowel sound. They assume that Italian /ɔ/ is phonetically [ɔ], and English /ɔ/ is phonetically [ɔ] (an easy assumption to make, but not necessarily a safe assumption). So, they make a post asking for words with the /ɔ/ sound in English. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Someone responds with a list of a few sample words with the /ɔ/ phoneme, a description of lexical sets, and discussion of how members of this lexical set vary across different American dialects. This would be a great answer to a question about the dialectical phonology of /ɔ/. However, the original poster misses out on learning useful information about the phonetic details that were actually the original motivation for their question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important point about this imaginary scenario is that nobody – the original poster, the answerers, and so on – will be able to realize that the original poster was motivated by an “unsafe assumption,” and missed out on useful information. The original poster thinks that they’ve gotten the information they need, and the answerer thinks they’ve provided all the relevant information about /ɔ/ in English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this story far-fetched? Yes. But I don’t think you can disprove this story about the OP of that question, because they have not responded to anyone or clarified what their question is really about. Until that happens, or until someone decides that the OP has abandoned the question and edits it to have a clear purpose, there aren’t any objective criteria for selecting one answer as the best for that question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**An idea for what to do**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to answer a question that was suggested to you by someone else's question, I think the best solution would be to post it as a new question. I assume it would not be closed as an exact duplicate if the original is closed for being unclear. For example, in this case, you could post and answer a question &quot;Are there differences in the distribution of the phoneme /ɔ/ across different dialects of English? If so, what are they, and what are the relevant sound-changes and cross-dialectical correspondences?&quot; I think that's sufficiently different from &quot;give me words with /ɔ/&quot; that it wouldn't be closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm unsure about this suggestion, however. Perhaps it would be better to simply edit the OP's question to what you want to answer, and then see if the OP responds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12740/english-words-with-the-%C9%94-vowel-sound" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

My opinion is that computer programming techniques about language as opposed to numbers are not related to or treated by linguistics (which includes subcategories), but I observe that there are many such questions here that survive, so I guess I don't understand what is treated by linguistics.

IMO closing questions on this grounds is “unfair” because it is not enumerated in the “and is not about” list (advice or help on learning a foreign language; translation requests; trees; things not about linguistics). Nor do I think that you can reasonably infer that language-specific grammar and usage questions are “not about linguistics”, based on the “is about” list. One can conclude that Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic if one has enough reputation to close questions and have actually tried to close a question and encounter this reason; or if you keep track of currently-visible closed questions and see this reason. But I don’t think that is a reasonable requirement for knowing what is off-topic, given that we could simply fix the help center to mention this basis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A dozen questions were closed over the past 90 days on this grounds. An example of a question closed on this basis is the [2-verbs question][1], which asks if having 2 consecutive verbs (in English) means that the first is an auxiliary. The question does not ask about a causal linguistic explanation, it just asks if this is a correct generalization, and it is only about English. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One inference you could make about the “Language-specific” restriction is that questions about a specific language are off-topic. If that is the intent, then we do a poor job of closing questions, because very many questions that don’t get closed are about single languages. Some recent examples (I’m not proposing that these should be closed) are [this][2], [this][3] and [this][4]. These questions do not clearly invoke a scientific linguistic issue (whereas the [Malay copula question][5] is more clearly “concerned with linguistics”). Based on actual patterns of question non-closure, I surmise that a question about a single language which does not have a discernible theoretical linguistic agenda is not per se off topic. I do not know what a ban on language-specific grammar questions is supposed to achieve, and I don’t see how the targeted question-askers could understand what they are not supposed to do. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The “unless” clause (“unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage”) of this closure-ground is also puzzling, since “linguistics” vs. “usage” is a false dichotomy. Not everything is either “about linguistics” or “about usage”, and I do not see what “rather than usage” contributes. The 2-verbs question is basically about a grammatical generalization, though not expressed in terms of any theory of syntax, but it is not about “usage”, at least in any meaning of “usage” that I have ever encountered. I have no idea what kinds of bad things are supposed to be excluded by not allowing questions about usage. Is this code for questions with prescriptive presuppositions (and if so, why do we not simply make clear what our ideological stance is regarding normative topics, even scientific (sociolinguistic) ones?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another example of a “language-specific” question is the [&quot;productivity&quot; question][6] which basically asks whether the semantics of “productivity” and “creativity” are the same. In this case, I can see a connection between the question and “usage”, since this is a referential question about semantics, asking whether the extension of the terms is identical (though not using such a fancy term as “extension”). A dumb way to ask whether “cat” and “dog” have the same semantic properties is to ask if they can be felicitously used the same way. I would not have assumed that a question asking about the referential properties of two words is about “usage”, and this is certainly not a violation of any anti-normativity question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The closure of the [&quot;yet-history&quot; question][7] about the historical semantics of English “yet” is likewise puzzling, since it asks about multiple languages (I don’t speak Old English or Middle English but I do speak Modern English, therefore these are not the same language).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now the question part. First, can someone explain the intent of the sentence “Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage”. Second, can we make the help center accurately reflect that intent?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Addendum]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding questions of the type &quot;Do I use on or in with verb X?&quot;, there are a number of ways such a question might be posed (applied to &quot;stand ___ line&quot;, in English). Specifically:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Should I say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&#xD;&#xA; - In Standard English, do you say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&#xD;&#xA; - Do English speakers usually say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&#xD;&#xA; - In English, does the verb &quot;stand&quot; select &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on&quot; before &quot;line&quot; as a complement?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first phrasing is explicitly normative, and the other three are descriptive, thus in some minimal way linguistic. Is it just the first version that should be avoided, or all three? Also, note that I'm only asking about questions that are to be closed, not ones that can be migrated to a different SE site. A valid dichotomy would be between descriptive questions and normative questions. Does it accomplish the intent of the &quot;Language-specific&quot; restriction to say that all normative questions are off-topic? The first version of the question would be OT given that. The other versions of the question ask for factual information. Since &quot;Standard English&quot; is not a well-defined object, the second version of the question would really run afoul of the opinion-based restriction, though applied to some other language with an actual codified standard, there could be such a thing as a correct answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12820/if-two-verbs-are-in-a-row-is-the-first-always-an-auxiliary&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13062/what-accent-for-the-english-language-is-most-widely-and-easily-understood&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13082/north-american-english-r-muscles-and-linguistic-description&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13073/is-the-prefix-proto-reserved-only-for-unattested-languages&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/11373/interrogatives-and-copulas-in-malay&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12911/what-is-the-difference-between-creativity-and-productivity&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12958/what-connects-and-explains-the-many-meanings-of-yet" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There are many language-specific sites where such questions are welcomed; see: http://stackexchange.com/sites&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I comprehend that prescriptive questions (eg: of usage) are off-topic, but what of  questions necessitating linguistics knowledge about a specific language? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, though language-specific sites feature native speakers, they may not be linguists and so would be unable to answer a question as helpfully or meaningfully as here.

The same problem exists for questions of Historical Linguistics for one language X; for example, most native speakers of X cannot connect an English or French Word to Proto-X as only a linguist can. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Example Question as a Test:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`Title:` How else might the Latin 'torrere' have drifted semantically to mean 'rushing, roaring (of streams)'?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`Question`: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[[Etymonline]](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=torrent) [...] from Latin *torrentem* (nominative *torrens*) &quot;rushing, roaring&quot; (of streams), also &quot;a rushing stream,&quot; originally as an adjective &quot;roaring, boiling, burning, parching, hot, inflamed,&quot; present participle of *torrere* &quot;to parch&quot; (see [terrain](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=terrain&amp;allowed_in_frame=0)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Google revealed only [one conjecture](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KDuAaVDUxb8J:mittani.blogspot.com/2009/06/notes-on-etymology-of-torrent.html+&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;So, what could be the connection between a rushing stream and something which is dried out, thirsting for some water?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Supposedly, the contrasting meanings are linked by the image of a mountain creek or river which may be a raging current in spring, but dries out in summer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Somehow the above is unpersuasive, probably because:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. most raging streams do not dry;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. it is factually false to refer to a dried raging stream still as a `raging stream``; one would have said 'dried raging stream'. 'dry' and 'rushing, roaring' are polar opposites;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know that etymology is subjective and speculative, but are there any other conjectures that might possess more conviction?

A question does not have to be at such a basic level such that every person on the planet will instantly understand it, but it should be possible for someone who doesn't to come to an understanding in a reasonable amount of time. Questions concerning obscure topics such as yours should be accompanied by links or citations to books.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I search [Google for &quot;vertical dimension of sentence structure&quot;](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=vertical+dimension+of+sentence+structure), the first result is your own question, which is not a good sign. The [second result](http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/Syntax/TheHorizontalAndVerticalDimensionOfSentences) doesn't seem to be about anything other than the idea that linguists draw syntax trees. Down further is a [Wikipedia article on Catena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catena_(linguistics)), a topic in dependency grammars, which does seem similar to your answers, but it doesn't mention declensions or case which your question does. Other responses link to several books in Google Books. In none of these is it clear that they are talking about what you are asking about. For this reason it is completely appropriate that your question be closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But in fact, as you wrote in [a comment](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/17271/how-can-psg-describe-the-vertical-dimension-of-sentence-structure#comment41397_17271), this concept of a &quot;vertical dimension&quot; is an original feature of your theory!

Your ten answers come to just over 20000 characters. Even accounting for formatting they would fit comfortably in a single post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But posting a multi part answer is a distraction from the real problem with your question. You have a new theory, and I guess you want some feedback on it. You have in effect posted a moderate length research article here. You should not be posting it here, you should be submitting it to a journal. If you want feedback I'm sure many of our community members would be interested in reading it, so you should ask on chat for that. I'd be interested myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Something like this needs to be written and formatted as a research article, with an introduction, explanation of the problem, some level of literature review, development of the new model, and arguments for why it has superior explanatory power over existing models."

Are there &quot;grey area&quot; questions that you've accepted, perhaps grudgingly, but might receive better attention elsewhere?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If such questions do or have existed, I'd love to know, then Language Learning can decide to what extent we would be equipped to handle such questions."

A similar request was already made on meta [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1662/feature-request-let-us-easily-write-in-ipa-and-tree-diagrams).  &#xD;&#xA;This is where I don't know for sure what is technically possible: Since trees are not part of the defaultly implemented LaTeX inventory, typesetting trees in the editor would require supporting external packages, like `tikz-qtree` which I use to make my graphics.  &#xD;&#xA;This issue would be slightly less high on my priority list than the formula stuff, but still very nice to have and certainly useful for many users here.&#xD;&#xA; - **IPA**, as already discussed [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22/how-should-we-facilitate-ipa-entry) and [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/600/better-font-for-rendering-ipa-esp-diacritics), to frequently be used in posts like [here](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18882/assimilation-help/18883#18883), [here](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18843/are-there-languages-which-require-aspiration-for-some-stops/18844#18844), [here](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18914/having-trouble-with-assigning-stress-degrees-to-a-long-compound/18919#18919) and many posts by other users.  &#xD;&#xA;I am aware of [IPA typeit](http://ipa.typeit.org/full/) which I used so far, and other external tools, but even with the most intelligent keyboard integration (the less I need to use the mouse, the more efficiently I can work), being able to typeset IPA symbols directly in the editor would ease asking and answering phonetics and pohnology-related questions.  &#xD;&#xA;Besides allowing for maximal flexibility and speicalised characters which no tool I have seen so far can compete with, LaTeX integration in the editor would be completely independent of devices - as much as I appreciate the effort people make to create tools like [this one](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/454/ipa-keyboard-userscript-for-you), I find it an unsatisfying solution that one needs to install an extra program to be able to properly write phonetic symbols when this would by the help of LaTeX be possible with any normal QWERTY keyboard, even from mobile devices.  &#xD;&#xA;A further convenience of having something like `tipa` included in a linguistics site would be in providing the well-known LaTeX commands that versed users are already familiar with from LaTeX being the presumably undoubted standard to typeset IPA in professional papers.  &#xD;&#xA; - Other, less urgent cases where I could imagine TeX support to be useful - again under the premise that support for special package is in general possible - would be **linguistic example formatting** (in the format *(1) (a) Peter likes fish (b) Peter likes the fish* with running numbers, proper alignment and grammaticality judgements), which I could have used [here](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/18911/13238), or **interlinear glosses** for posts like [here](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1045/thematic-roles-in-some-languages?rq=1), which are very inconvenient to do appropriately without automatic alignment; both would be possible e.g. with `covington` - although I could live with those cases being needed to be typeset externally and then included in the post via screenshots.  &#xD;&#xA;There sure are a lot of other uses for more special purposes that I considered less relevant here.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this wishlist being very long and probably not in full length equally important to everyone, I think that inclusion of simple mathematical typesetting similar as on [Math SE](https://math.stackexchange.com/) using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) would be a great and hopfully not too impossible improvement to start with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any feedback on how likely those suggestions are to be considered is appreciated!"

Shouldn't we rather rename it to &quot;language-request&quot; or something similar?    &#xD;&#xA; - &lt;s&gt;[tag:language-identification] Why does this tag even exist - didn't&#xD;&#xA;   we define such questions as out of the scope of this site?  &lt;/s&gt; It is now, but once was on-topic and we should just leave the existing questions as-is&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:natural-languages] Seems a bit redundant - remove?  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:history] It was already discussed [here](https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/104/what-to-do-about-the-history-tag), but without a real solution: What do we want to have this tag for? Do we refer to historical&#xD;&#xA;   linguistics (then I would rather use the&#xD;&#xA;   [tag:historical-linguistics] directly), history of linguistic theory&#xD;&#xA;   (then we should consider renaming it to &quot;history-of-linguistics&quot; or&#xD;&#xA;   &quot;history-of-theory&quot; or something) or the influence of historical context on the development of languages (but this should then again boil down to&#xD;&#xA;   [tag:historical-linguistics] or sometimes [tag:sociolinguistics])? Proposal by Alenanno: rename it to &quot;histocial-context&quot;  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:ancient] This is not very expressive - I would rather go with more&#xD;&#xA;   accurate tags like &quot;ancient-greek&quot; or &quot;ancient-hebrew&quot; etc.  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:symbol] This is used pretty unhomogeneously. Most of these questions are about writing systems, unicode or IPA where there is already tags for&#xD;&#xA;   that; the rest are not really linguistic questions i.m.o. (such as a&#xD;&#xA;   question about emoticons). The only question with a reasonable use of the&#xD;&#xA;   tag I found so far is [this&#xD;&#xA;   one](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/15561/do-symbols-include-only-morphemes),&#xD;&#xA;   but looking at the other questions tagged with this tag, &quot;symbol&quot; doesn't really help classifying questions into a more or less homogeneous group of interest which makes its need questionable. Should we&#xD;&#xA;   delete the tag and, if necessary, change the tags of the few&#xD;&#xA;   remaining question to others? I would suggest using it in the context of semiotics, like in the question I linked, but then we should careful that it doesn't overlap with [tag:writing-systems], [tag:ipa] etc.&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:marking] - ambiguous again; both used as [tag:markedness] and [tag:morphology] - should we better restrict it to one meaning; if so, which one, or should we remove it completely and simply re-tag the existing four questions?  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:variation] - seems to be used very unhomogeneously again - what to do with it? I'd say we use it in the sanse of language variation (dialects, sociolects, ...) - but we need an informative tag wiki then.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:lexical-relations] - &lt;s&gt;only three questions, one about semantics,&#xD;&#xA;   one about verbs, one about syntax - do we need it?&lt;/s&gt; A tag wiki has been suggested, the wrongly tagged questions removed, and more questions tagged correctly&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:numbers] is always only used in the sense of [tag:numerals] (which makes sense since this is a linguistics and not a mathematics site). We now have tag wikis so in the future they will hopefully be used appropriately, but I'm still wondering whether there is a good use for [tag:numbers] here?&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:research] - it's either about [tag:reference-request] or any of the other tags (like research questions about English, historical linguistics etc.), so it's not really needed - or we should add a precise tag wiki&#xD;&#xA; - &lt;s&gt;[tag:synatx] - This is a typo&lt;/s&gt; removed  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, I would suggest merging or synonymising a bunch of tags (is the direction relevant?):  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:resources] - [tag:resource-request] - [tag:online-resources] - [tag:reference-request] - [tag:references] Proposal by Alenanno: [tag:reference-request] for essays, papers etc, [tag:resource-request] for corpora etc. - I find that a useful distrinciton. What about the rest then?      &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:vocabulary] - [tag:lexicon]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:word-classes] - [tag:parts-of-speech]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:constructed-language] - [tag:conlang]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:grammatical-number] - [tag:number]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:origin-of-language] - [tag:evolutionary-linguistics]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:computer-science] - [tag:computational-linguistic] - [tag:nlp] I think we'd need to discuss the current tag synonymy of [tag:computational-linguistics] and [tag:nlp] in a separate thread, opinions on that apparently vary  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:morphemes] - [tag:morphology] - one is the subject of study of the other, but in which question context couldn't both of the tags be used? &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:discourse] - [tag:discourse-analysis]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:stops] - [tag:plosives]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:writing] - [tag:writing-systems]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:proper-nouns] - [tag:proper-names] - [tag:names]  &#xD;&#xA;  - &lt;s&gt;[tag:thematic-roles] - [tag:theta-role]&lt;/s&gt; agreed with what Alenanno wrote  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:meaning] - [tag:semantics]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:diachronic] - [tag:historical-linguistics] or [tag:language-change]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:constituency] - [tag:constituents]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:annotated-data] - [tag:annotation]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:dependency] - [tag:dependency-grammar]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:slavic] - [tag:slavic-languages]  &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:software] - [tag:nlp] - So far, all of the software-tagged questions are about NLP tools. But skimming through the questions, possibly the difference is that the former is usually rather requests for existing tools, while the latter is used for problems in creating NLP software? If so, I'd be okay with leaving them separately, but then we should be more specific about theird intended usage in the tag wikis.      &#xD;&#xA;  - [tag:tools] - [tag:nlp] - same as with [tag:software]   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Others that have rather few usage could easily be subsumed under more general terms:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:sociophonetics] - Do we need an own tag for this? This field is sufficiently covered by [tag:sociolinguistics] and [tag:phonetics] i.m.o.&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:graphemics] and [tag:diacritics] - aren't these subsumed under [tag:writing-systems]?   &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:dialect-mapping] - only two questions - subsume under [tag:dialects]?&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:prestige] - only two quetsions - subsume under [tag:sociolinguistics]? &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:toponmastics] - I have never heard that term before, couldn't we just subsume this under [tag:proper-names]? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And other tags are so extremely specific in their scope or unique to one particular question used I doubt that they will ever be used so one might actually delete them:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [tag:spe]  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:wonderwort] (What is this? jknappen says it looks like a misspelling of &quot;wanderwort&quot; - I'd say we don't need that one, is sufficiently covered by [tag:etymology] already)  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:philology]  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:translation-quality]  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:nominalisation]  &#xD;&#xA; - [tag:grammatical]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There were some more that were rather specific or seldomly used, but the ones above seemed the most redundant to me.&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;I don't expect you to discuss extensively on every bullet point I made - a comment on one or a few points or if someone could do the tag synonyms (I don't have enough reputation to do that on my own) would already be nice."

Yes, it can be removed.&#xD;&#xA;2. Yes, they should be all synonym tags of [tag:writing-systems].&#xD;&#xA;3. Yes.&#xD;&#xA;4. Uhm, yes.&#xD;&#xA;5. Study of place names, although maybe it should be [tag:toponymy]. I think it should be at best a synonym of [tag:proper-nouns], since this is also the main tag I proposed for [tag:proper-names].  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: If we make it synonyms, does this make sure that questions tagged [tag:proper-names] don't somewhere show up as [tag:toponymy]?*&#xD;&#xA;6. It sounds like a meta-tag, but I'm not sure, so I may leave it for the time being.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: It is a meta-tag, but used pretty often (5 times already only this month) so I would definitely keep it, just thuoght a more intuitive name would help new users use it.*  &#xD;&#xA;7. [tag:language-identification] questions may be kept (not sure we ruled on them being banned in all cases), but I'd be strongly in favor of setting restrictions on how to handle them. In case these already exist, upgrade them.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: I don't think existing questions should be deleted either, but maybe to prevent new questions (it's alreay said in the help center, but when users see that a tag exists they might think such questions are still okay) we could place an information to the tag wiki?*  &#xD;&#xA;8. Yes, should be removed. We already have [tag:constructed-languages] to distinguish. Linguistics is primarily about natural languages anyway.&#xD;&#xA;9. I may agree with Aaron's proposal [tag:historical-context]. It sounds like a nice substitute for [tag:history] which seems very vague.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: Yes, this sounds good.*&#xD;&#xA;10. Agreed. It should be removed in favor of more specific tags, like the ones you suggested.  &#xD;&#xA;11. Not sure about deleting it, but it needs to be seen how it could be used. The concept of symbols is not all external to Linguistics.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: I would suggest using it in the context of semiotics, like in the question I linked, but then we should careful that it doesn't overlap with [tag:writing-systems], [tag:ipa] etc.*&#xD;&#xA;12. The linguistic term is [tag:markedness], so we should delete [tag:marking]. It's also redundant.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: The tag is not always used in the sense of markedness, some uses are about moprhological marking. But it's only four questions in total anyway, so we could just re-tag them.*&#xD;&#xA;13. We should write a decent tag wiki to describe how to properly use it, but as a concept it is valid, so we should keep it.  &#xD;&#xA;*lemontree: So we should stick to a use in the sense of language variation (like dialects or sociolects)?*&#xD;&#xA;14. Lexical semantics is a subfield of semantics, so maybe this one might be redundant.

One is the general range of topics that are within the scope of linguistics, and the other is whether a particular question would be on-topic here. As for the first issue, you can broadly say that linguistics is the scientific study of the nature of human language, which means describing and modelling the systems that give rise to the epiphenomenon known as &quot;Language&quot;. For example, it is a linguistic question whether in English (broadly construed) sentences can have two consecutive modal verbs: should, might, ought to... As a descriptive (scientific) fact, the answer depends on what dialect of English you are talking about. In my dialect, \*&quot;We might should go&quot; is ungrammatical, but I know of other dialects where this is grammatical and fairly common. In terms of modelling, it is also a linguistic question how you might account for either of those facts – what formal feature of grammar describes those facts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A third question is the normative one, &quot;*Should* you say 'We might should go'&quot;. This is the epitome of a &quot;usage&quot; question (off-topic), and cannot be answered scientifically. There is no objective fact that determines what you *should* do when it comes to language, and we only deal in &quot;can (not)&quot; and &quot;must (not)&quot; in the sense &quot;is (not) even part of the language&quot;. So a question about the actual meaning of a word could be linguistically on-topic, and could be answered with reference to objective facts. A question about what the meaning of a word *should* be (e.g. whether the meaning of &quot;sofa&quot; should be different from the meaning of &quot;couch&quot;) is purely a matter of opinion, not science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any question of modelling facts presupposes a description of the facts, so obviously you can't model the &quot;difference&quot; between &quot;guess&quot; and &quot;estimate&quot; if there is no actual difference. A question of the form 'does X adequately model the difference in meaning between &quot;guess&quot; and &quot;estimate&quot;?' is meaningful and answerable (where &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; might actually be true) only if there *is* a difference in meaning: but there isn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As pointed out in the relevant question, there may be a stylistic usage difference – but such questions are off-topic for this site (and on-topic for the English site). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Although it is about just one language, there is no rule against asking a question about a single language. Unfortunately, there is substantial confusion over the &quot;language specific grammar and usage questions&quot; rule, and is not spelled out in any way in the help center. This rule being only visible as an unadvertised close reason, you really can't predict whether a question about the linguistic history of a single language will get closed. That close-reason also says &quot;**unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage**. There are many language-specific sites where such questions are welcomed; see: http://stackexchange.com/sites&quot;.

However, I often have doubts as to whether I should vote to close these questions. This is because if someone were to ask for the etymology of a word from an 'exotic' language family or branch such as Pama-Nyungan, Algonquian, Gur or Polynesian, etc., my intuition would be to accept such a question (even though I've never seen such questions here myself). This is because linguists in linguistics departments do study etymology in these languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another possible reason for rejecting etymology questions is that they aren't useful for other visitors to the site. But while syntax trees and language identification clearly fall into this category, etymology seems less clear-cut. It could well be that more than one person wants to know, say, the common origin of the different words for 'night' in Indo-European languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally, I found this in the [FAQs](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic), listed among the acceptable question types:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* a single word in relation to multiple languages or a single word/single language&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does this imply that etymology questions should ordinarily be acceptable?"

That would be a distraction from the linguistic question. Third, the link points to an over-broadness underlying the question, because you're mixing cases, one involving the common situation of people speaking distinct languages, and the other (in the link) involving a person who has limited ability to communicate in any language (e.g. due to stroke, mental illness, and other such causes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, you should have an actual question. &quot;Surely there's something better&quot; isn't a question with an objective answer.

The epitome of high-level theory is formalization. I do agree that many such questions are better suited elsewhere, but that is because this place is not generally populated by specialists who know the linguistic *and* mathematical details. Finally, as a narrow theoretician I would still maintain that there is a place for applied and methodological questions, such as how Markov models might be used in speech recognition or whether information theory has anything to say relevant to the study of meaning. So likewise, formal language questions are *particularly* germane to a grammarian, since theoretical linguistics has been plagued by decades of sloppy, informal thinking about what notations and conventions mean (IMO).

Some random thoughts. &#xA; &#xA;&#xA; - LI obviously falls among a linguist's tasks. Who else would do that, otherwise? Imagine a government that needs to know the origin and identity of a written document. Whom would they ask for an expertise? No one but a linguist or a philologist. History and identification of writing systems is something that a historical linguist is supposed to know. People who submit most of the proposals to the Unicode consortium for the standardization of certain scripts or glyphs are either script freaks or linguists (often both). &#xA;&#xA; - Sometimes LI is indeed tough. Not because the picture is blurred but because the inscription is too ancient, non-standard or badly written. Or, there could be two different languages using the same writing system and only a specialist could be able to tell the difference between them. To sum up, I can imagine many situations when a LI would be a tough task to accomplish even for a linguist. &#xA;&#xA; - Questions concerning LI might seem naïf and useless, but, let me say this: a good percentage of questions submitted to Linguistics Stack Exchange are naïf and totally unscientific. What non specialists know, presume to know, or ask about language is always naïf and wrong, from the viewpoint of a linguist. Are we here for helping people or just for telling them to shut up because they cannot formulate meaningful questions on linguistics?&#xA;&#xA; - However stupid a question might be, there is always something intelligent and useful that a specialist can say as an answer. And indeed this is what usually happens: the answers take the inspiration form questions to teach something of general interest. Including the cases of LI questions.

Quoting the &quot;About off-topicness&quot; section of the question right below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This has been put on hold as &quot;seeking help with identification or translation of specific samples of text&quot;. This is only part of the picture. The reference to the song is, on one hand, the background: I found the word in (some versions of) that song. On the other hand, it is a usage example of the word, and the whole reason I believe there might be another sense to it besides the name of the procession in the mentioned festival. If I had another example hinting at such a figurative sense, I would have brought that one too. Except I have none. So this is not about the song, but rather about the etymology and meaning of &quot;atturna&quot; in Sicilian, as the title states. Is it off-topic to ask about where a word comes from and what it means? Or is asking such things about a Sicilian word off-topic, whereas e.g. for an English word it is on-topic? I believe the answer to both those questions is &quot;no&quot;, which makes this question perfectly on-topic. I will try to make this clearer by editing the beginning."

Some questions can't and shouldn't be answered: unclear ones, opinion ones – these get closed. Also ones that aren't about linguistics. For the other questions, we want answers, not deletion (filtering out). There is a pseudo-tag for identifying those questions, namely the &quot;unanswered&quot; tab at the top. There's no answer for the [Slender r question][1], nor [комбинаторная категориальная грамматика][2], or the [don't have verbs][3] question. An alternative to tagging questions is saying &quot;Folks, how about reviewing some of those questions and answering them?&quot;. A specific way to get questions answered is to put a bounty on them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The merit of leaving unanswered questions out there is that they might get answered some day.

I think the restriction should be about there being a way to actually verify an answer, such as a published grammar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I disagree with [the disagreement][1] (not trying to encourage an infinite regress). Put very simply, there is no reasonable and answerable question about conlangs that cannot be framed strictly as a question about natural languages. If you want to decide whether to make your conlang VOS, you should decide privately how that question could ever be answered objectively. If you want the language to exhibit the least-frequent properties of human languages (or the most frequent), then ask a question about natural language. Don't ask for opinions about what you should do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also disagree with the position that linguistics is specifically the study of any given language. Linguistics is the study of the nature of language, and not the accumulation of studies of individual languages. Linguistics is not the social history of the word &quot;meat&quot; in English, it is not about normative judgments such as the prohibition against &quot;ain't&quot;, it is not about programming tips for text mining, and it is not answers to questions like &quot;What is the accusative plural of 'horse' in Sanskrit?&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The implication that we are trying to impose a world view on innocent people is wrong (&quot;people have an agenda and try to impose it on others as though they're not allowed to ask questions here&quot;). There is a huge difference between a focused Q&amp;A website, and an open ended discussion forum. If you want an open-ended discussion where all comments are equal, then go to a discussion forum, and not a fact-seeking site. The very reason why SE exists at all is that there are technical questions which need answering by knowledgeable people. The rules of SE are there to preserve the function of SE, to keep it from turning into a discussion forum which just accumulates personal opinions. **Of course** there are questions that you are not supposed to ask here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1781/6726" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

What does it *mean* to ask, as a question of linguistics, &quot;What does it mean for 'sense' to be 'an intrinsic property of the word', and to give the word 'its power of referring to something'?&quot;. Are you really asking a question about meaning, or are you asking someone to justify Roberts' choice of words? Even though the terms you're using are terms used in linguistics, I don't understand what intrinsically linguistic question you are asking." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If you provide the tree yourself and ask questions about it (maybe you want a clarification or you have doubts about something), that is on topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why do I think there's a problem? Because there's a chunk of the community that's absolutely sure that there _is_ a rule that _anything_ with any syntax tree is automatically off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, see the comments on [this question](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/30230/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Tree diagrams are not permitted on SEL. - BillJ&#xD;&#xA;* @BillJ There are plenty of questions and answers with tree diagrams, and, AFAIK, the only rule about them is that you can't just ask &quot;can someone diagram this&quot; homework questions. Is there something I'm missing? - abarnert&#xD;&#xA;* @BillJ There is no such rule. – prash♦&#xD;&#xA;* @prash Nonsense. The rules clearly state that tree diagrams are OFF-TOPIC. -BillJ&#xD;&#xA;* @BillJ Point me to those rules. – prash♦&#xD;&#xA;* @prash I'm not here to spoon-feed you. Read the rules yourself and you'll find it in there somewhere. In any case, why does it bother you so much? You've made no contribution in this thread other than to nit-pick about the rules. - BillJ&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Shortly after that last comment, the question received a VtC, and soon had 5 votes and was closed. (BillJ's last comment is 5 hours ago; the close was 4 hours ago.) The close reason is, of course, &quot;Questions requesting to make syntax trees are not within the scope defined in the help center. For any doubt, please ask on Meta.&quot; The question isn't an _amazing_ one, but it clearly matches &quot;you provide the tree yourself and ask questions about it (maybe you want a clarification or you have doubts about something)&quot; from the meta answer, so it shouldn't be closed."

Etymology questions belong here when they're asking about systematic issues. This could involve sound system changes. It could be about languages which have borrowed wholesale and systematically from another language. And questions on grammatical morphology are almost always on topic. But non systematic arbitrary borrowings or meaning changes don't really belong here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When your question was asking about whether several European languages had inherited their words or whether they had later all constructed them as calques, that's a systematic issue. But now you're not asking about that, you're asking about the original formation of the word in whichever language it originated in. It's the origin of a single word, no longer focused on anything systematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I call it arbitrary because words can develop their meanings in innumerable ways. Usually through some idiomatic accident in one culture and time. It's up to question askers to demonstrate that their questions are about systematic issues; if you don't, I will assume that a question about a single word is not systematic and I'll vote to close."

It was coined by the Danish scholar C. Malte-Brun in its French form *indo-germanique* in 1800 and it has traditional usage throughout the 19th and early 20th century also in the anglophone literature. Moves to stamp it out from anglophone terminology were undertaken in the 1920ies before the raise of the Nazi movement to power.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Nazis ideology wasn't about a linguistic supremacy (unlike some forms of French chauvinism), it was about an esoteric concept of &quot;race&quot; inspired by [Helena Blavatsky][1] and theosophic ideas.

I have no evidence that the word *indogermanisch* was used  prominently by the Nazi movement (*Arier* and *arisch* **were used a lot** and were at the core of their propaganda).

My only hope is to offer a constructive discussion and to raise one's awareness of some terminological conventions in professional linguistic research done in English and awareness of connotations of certain words in present-day English.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are my thoughts on this. The question is about the use of the term &quot;Indo-Germanic&quot; **in English**, not in German.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not going to discuss the origin of the term itself or how specifically it was used by the ideologues of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany - this is well-known to linguists and a lot of research has been written on this, in English, Italian, etc. and even in German - for example, see the quote below from Kahane 1987:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The fact is that **the term &quot;Indo-Germanic&quot; is no longer used by the international professional linguistic community**, whether their L1 is English or German or any other language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a convention of the English language, a terminological convention adopted by professional linguists, and frankly, one's insistence on using &quot;Indo-Germanic&quot; in English in 2019 does indeed look rather suspicious.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [Ruth Römer][2], a German linguist, the author of the monograph [“Sprachwissenschaft und Rassenideologie in Deutschland”][3] (1985), wrote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;“Heute gibt es keine deutsche Sprachwissenschaft mehr, es gibt nur noch eine internationale.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me pose another, very important question. How may it affect the reputation of Linguistics SE, its perception? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;For a linguist - be it a full-fledged researcher or just an undergrad student - **this is a sign of amateurism**, i.e. they would not find Linguistics SE particularly insightful or informative nor would they take it seriously. To a layperson who is interested in linguistics, especially in historical linguistics, this would be **a disservice** because it misrepresents the field of historical linguistics, esp. its present-day conceptual, terminological apparatus. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5bCi0.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_R%C3%B6mer&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.fink.de/katalog/titel/978-3-7705-2266-8.html" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

SE explicitly favors down-voting questions as contrasted with answers (and not that there is no up-vote reward). There is a non-generous interpretation of how multiple down-votes arise in cases where a question is not egregiously bad (blood in the water analogies), which is similar to serial close-voting. I think that is just the way it is on SE, and it's not obvious what there is that could be looked into. I question the assertion that down-voting is not related to content (how do you know it is?), and I suggest you consider the alternative explanation of ideological voting (it's not the structure of the argument, it's the viewpoint that you reflect). Ideological voting is not exactly rare on SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's not that I dispute the premise that there exists personal animus (or adoration) as a basis for voting, it's that I don't see that this is a solvable problem under the SE model of content evaluation.

As long as it's all done with one account, I'm confident votes from other users will help promote worthwhile contributions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you see a better answer than your own, please accept that instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for good examples here, I don't know. Some of the Q&amp;As linked from the meta site show examples not related to linguistics, but at least demonstrate that good questions and answers accrue a lot of karma."

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - relevant linguistic blogs and websites&#xD;&#xA; - events, conferences, or meetups for linguists&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

The most basic comparison of theories would probably be Minimalism vs. HPSG. I am dubious that anybody is both capable and willing to set forth such a comparison, though perhaps two people could collaborate (example [here][1]). I will say that that specific paper is not an exemplar of what you seem to be looking for, because it seems to presuppose that you know both theories, and you just need someone to point out the similarities and differences. That's lacking with beginners/outsiders seeking guidance, but may be a useful reference for pointed discussions.

Actually, you can get a certain amount of information about theories from [Wikipedia][2]. I imagine a number of articles in linguistics have been progagated to other wiki-like sites. The apt question for Ling SE is, what kind of wiki pages would serve the particular needs of *this* site, which is not a substitute for a systematic education in linguistics. IMO an Ling SE comparison of major syntactic theories fills a much-needed gap in the literature. There are some repeated questions about phonemes that we get that are repetitive enough that they ought to be closed as &quot;asked and answered&quot;. I don't know what would be such questions in syntax: *are* there any annoying questions that get asked over and over.

Two rationales have been given for this rule: (1) we don't do people's homework and (2) there are too many theories of syntax to be able to answer that question. I agree with those premises. However, I disagree with how the rule is stated, and have more than once advocated restating the rule. [This question][1] approaches the problem that I see. We have a question that would in principle be a good and answerable question, except that we have no idea what framework is assumes. The vast majority of tree questions are bad for both reasons (theory over-breadth and homework-solving). This one only suffers from the breadth problem, which I think is solvable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In light of the fact that the existing &quot;no tree&quot; rule is dysfunction in not communicating the underlying reason, and the rule(s) could be easily repaired by articulating a &quot;no homework&quot; rule (thereby also properly including other kinds of homework questions like phonology and morphology problems not covered by the tree rule), and connecting the lack-of-framework problem to the existing breadth / focus rule, is there a good reason to maintain the current rule?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An example of a tree question which *does* specify framework is [this one][2].

There are no comments associated with the question that indicate a reason for closing: what you can know is that 5 people VTC'd, at least one person clicked the &quot;Language-specific grammar&quot; box, possibly the first person did so, and maybe all 5 agreed with that assessment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no standardized or official guidance on what constitutes language-specific grammar, and no bright lines. Statistically-speaking, there are numerous strategies that might be followed to avoid this closure reason, which could increase the chances that some such question would survive. You should focus on the fact that linguistics is a general scientific discipline studying the nature of human language as a cognitive phenomenon, which ultimately means that we're devising a general theory of the language faculty. Language-learning mnemonics aimed at learning quirks of some language (the &quot;CaReFuL&quot; mnemonic for interpreting final consonants in French spelling) are not within the scope of linguistics. An understanding of rules of glide deletion and vocalization in Classical Arabic is within the scope of linguistics, and may (some possibility) have utility to the untrained language-learner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not the logically most-obvious reason, the first problem is that it is addressed to a very small set of specialists within linguistics. I don't know what &quot;ברוך הבא&quot; says – I think the first letter is aleph, so questions like this don't even get a read from me. A first step to making the question more general is to transliterate the data. A second step is to shed illusions about literal meaning – why not just accept that &quot;ברוך הבא&quot; means &quot;Welcome&quot;? What do you really want to know? What does בָּא have to do with the question? It appears that your &quot;real&quot; question is about the historical source of this expression. As a linguistic matter, either this is a canned construction, or it is a productive construction just as &quot;buys watercress&quot; would be a freshly-constructed collocation in English. What are you really asking (we used to call that &quot;unclear what you're asking&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A third problem is revealed in your suggestion that &quot;the phrase literally means 'Blessed be the comer' instead of 'The comer is blessed'&quot;, which is that &quot;ברוך הבא&quot; means &quot;רוך הבא&quot;, and strings like &quot;Blessed be the comer&quot; do not constitute the *meaning* of expressions in Hebrew, they are (possibly) a *translation* into English. And maybe (or maybe not) one translation into English better captures the meaning of some expression in some language better than a competing translation does. What real-word semantic difference do you think underlies the difference between 'Blessed be the comer' instead of 'The comer is blessed'? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't extract anything that is about the language faculty from this discussion, but I can imagine ways in which the question could be narrowed to a more-linguistic topic, regarding language change, syntax and semantics. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I think the difference is, to take another subject field at random, between &quot;What is x in 3x+5=10?&quot; and &quot;How do I teach 3rd graders how to multiply?&quot;. The key is that the second question is more about learning, while the first is about why something works that way.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Would more language questions that are not strictly linguistics be good or bad?&#xA;&#xA;If you don't enforce the rules slowly, it's a classic &quot;thin end of the wedge&quot; situation.

There is a question body so you can elaborate on the &quot;title/question&quot; in order to be more specific and clear about what you're asking. Providing info, not only reduces the risk of down-voting, but it also improves the chances of having a proper answer. *The better the question, the better the answers!*&#xA;&#xA;2. *Write appropriately and use the correct formatting*. This means use capitals letters and punctuation when it's required, also use the blockquotes for quotes and not the code-field, which exists to write code. A well-written question/answer is one of the steps of attracting better answers or upvotes too. Also, avoid writing a huge single paragraph. Five small paragraphs are more readable than a huge single one.&#xA;&#xA;3. *Don't write links like &quot;this&quot; or &quot;here&quot;*. Choose a wording where the text-link is the title of the document you're linking; specify when it's an image, for those who have slow connections.&#xA;&#xA;4. *If possible, include a reference*. Stackexchange sites are about definite, objective answers and not about opinions, (that's why we have the &quot;subjective question&quot; close vote), so providing reference, you're assuring the OP and the readers that what you say is true and backed up. &#xA;&#xA;5. *Avoid one-line answers*. It might be correct, but an answer made by a single sentence is not that informative. A bit of elaboration is very useful for the reader.&#xA;&#xA;6. *Be kind to other users*. If you're writing a question, remember that you're asking to be helped, so make sure to show your appreciation to the ones who answer by being kind. If you're answering, instead, don't attack the OP and don't be aggressive. It won't bring any good to the site. Like they say *&quot;Treat others as you wish to be treated&quot;*.&#xA;&#xA;**Last, but not least**, look at this page on how to ask a question properly: *&quot;[Writing the perfect question][1]&quot;*.&#xA;&#xA;-----&#xA;&#xA;Ideas?

The question was actually good (the subject) but it was vague and not so well-asked, besides the OP showed really no interest on improving it. (If the OP comes back and improves it, I can reopen it, assuming it will fit SE's and our standards.)&#xA;&#xA;Thanks for asking.&#xA;&#xA;I think we need to separate two things here: first, the subject of the question and second, the question itself.&#xA;&#xA; 1. **Subject/Topic**: I think most would agree but I'd like everybody to confirm or not that the topic of the question is actually *very* interesting for those who have studied Linguistics. Take the &quot;false friends&quot; for example. They're interesting for us, so why wouldn't a *whole sentence* that works as a false friend be interesting as well? &#xA;&#xA;    In other situations, the question would have been prompting for list questions, and this one is as well, but given the fact that such sentences are very rare, it might only prompt a few answers which is ok in terms of Q&amp;A requirements. As a proof for this, only one answer in that question actually provides a sentence. The others just words.&#xA;&#xA; 2. **Question**: The question has received downvotes and upvotes, while the answers only the latter. I could think that this is due to the fact that the question is not the best one I've seen in terms of wording and detail/context. Not to mention that the OP basically disappeared and we received no answers at all to our requests for clarifications. Maybe this is why it's getting downvotes.&#xA;&#xA;According to what comes out from this Meta question and also from what comes out between me and the other mods, I'm going to either save or close the question, but you (and everyone) must know that I'm tending to decide for **closing it**. Not for the topic, which is very interesting and stimulating, but for the fact that the OP didn't answer and we can't certainly edit the question without being aware of his/her real original intention. &#xA;&#xA;I think I addressed all of the points, but if there is something I missed, let me know."

This way we'd help you regardless of the difficulty of the question. :) **(2)** The question is more focused on the Linguistics aspect rather than the Usage one, because in that case it'd get off topic. &#xA;&#xA;   Anyway, these are guidelines to help everyone provide a better service. If you aren't sure whether your question is on topic or not, you can ask us before you post it, either on [Meta][2] or in [Chat][3]. Don't worry if there is no-one in chat at that moment, you can leave the message there and we'll reply as soon as we see it. :)&#xA;&#xA;8. *Questions about Sign Languages and [writing systems][4]*.&#xA;&#xA;9. *Questions about fictional/constructed/planned languages.* After the Conlang SE was closed and subsequently deleted, we have decided to accept [Conlangs][5]. Please make sure to visit that link in order to see what kind of questions are OK for Conlangs, we might not be able to answer all of them. [Esperanto][6] had already been deemed on topic prior to that.&#xA;&#xA;## Off Topic questions&#xA;&#xA;Apart from the questions considered off topic to any site (see the &quot;What questions should I not ask here&quot; section below), the questions described below are considered off topic:&#xA;&#xA;1. *Questions that are not about Linguistics and their subcategories.*&#xA;&#xA;2. *Translation-request questions.* Asking translations of any kind is off topic on this site. Language-related SE sites usually put this matter off topic if it's a simple question like &quot;Translate this for me&quot;, i.e. providing context and personal efforts can turn that question acceptable. But this site is not meant for any particular language and Linguistics doesn't treat about translation.&#xA;&#xA;   Still, if your question is about the linguistics reasons for some translations in different languages, etc., then it can be accepted. It will be necessary to check each question, since it's not reasonably possible to treat each case here. &#xA;&#xA;----&#xA;&#xA;As you might have noticed, the form counts a lot. Many times the wording/phrasing of your question would make it on topic even if *theoretically* that question asked in a more simple manner would be considered off topic.&#xA;&#xA;*If you still have questions or doubts that have not been covered until now*, then feel free to bring the matter on the [Meta][7] or in the [chat room][8]; either way, we'll be happy to help you.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/331/111&#xA;  [2]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/&#xA;  [3]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/&#xA;  [4]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11/111&#xA;  [5]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/433/111&#xA;  [6]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/367/111&#xA;  [7]: https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/&#xA;  [8]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Each of the four examples would have been migrated to ELL.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; A valid dichotomy would be between descriptive questions and normative questions.&#xA;&#xA;Personally, I am not really interested in this dichotomy. As you explained, questions of one of those kinds can be rephrased into questions of the other kind.&#xA;&#xA;This rule gives us a basis for migrating questions to other Stackexchange sites. Not all such questions can be migrated, for instance, when the language-specific question is about meaning or usage, but the language is not currently served by a Stackexchange site. We sometimes get questions about the meaning of phrases in Latin, Sanskrit, etc. This rule gives us a basis for closing the question in such cases.&#xA;&#xA;Regarding the question on &quot;creativity&quot; vs &quot;productivity&quot;, I understand &quot;productivity&quot; in linguistics, but haven't come across &quot;creativity&quot;. I would have closed the question for being unclear. However, I faulted my own limited expertise in linguistics, and gave the question the benefit of the doubt. To some extent, the questioner is at fault too. He asked about some terms, but did not explain how he currently understands them. And regarding the question on &quot;yet&quot;, all I saw was a bunch of largely related meanings. As with the previous question, my own preference is to close this question for being unclear. Instead, I deferred to other users to decide on these." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

SE sites are Q&amp;A sites: you post a question, and then a variable number of users will give you an answer to that question. Both can be long or short but you're not posting an essay, you're posting an answer. There's nothing wrong with an answer being long as long as whatever is inside is related to the question and since questions on SE are meant to have a narrow scope, answers aren't going to be that long because of that.&#xA;&#xA;If you ask a broad question, as is your case, then of course answers will have a lot more to cover, but the problem here is not the answers per se, it's the question. We have a close reason for broad questions because SE sites are meant to answer a more or less narrow topic.&#xA;&#xA;The same applies to &quot;discussion&quot;: this is not a forum, there are no discussions, or at least, there aren't any of the same type as those you could find on a forum board.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; One of the essays, on the question of intermediate forms in phonological derivations, has not yet been attacked. It is here: Eliminating intermediary forms to account for production and perception. The other essay, on the question of describing grammatical relations as differences in level (in a certain sense), which has been put on hold, is here: How can PSG describe the vertical dimension of sentence structure?.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Attacked&quot;? Maybe you shouldn't use loaded words, there was no attack. I'm just enforcing the rules of a website I've been called to supervise. The question I closed was called to my attention, the other I didn't see until now. I have and it seems fine, but your answers should be reduced to a single answer: just focus on the point of the question, you don't have to present a paper based on it. **Just answer the question.**&#xA;&#xA;&gt; The official reason cited for putting the second essay on hold was that it is &quot;too broad&quot;, specifically &quot;There are either too many possible answers, or good answers would be too long for this format. Please add details to narrow the answer set or to isolate an issue that can be answered in a few paragraphs.&quot; I'm not aware of any other answer that has ever been given to describe the factual instances of levels I gave in the third section of my essay (the answer titled Vertical levels), for instance the predicting of precisely five types of English auxiliary verbs. So I guess what is meant by the &quot;too broad&quot; objection is that &quot;good answers would be too long for this format&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Your guess is wrong, good answers are scoped, concise, to the point and while providing some context, they do not become essays. That's what the close reason means.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; But actually each of the answers I gave (corresponding to sections of the essay) is quite short. In the comments to my question, two commenters suggested that I reformat my essay as one long answer, as a remedy to the defect they saw in what I wrote, but of course that would make the new answer rather long. So how could that fix the problem of a question requiring a long answer? This does not make sense.&#xA;&#xA;Again, a long answer is not the problem if it's necessary to answer a well-scoped question. If the question is OK and you need to give a long answer to cover it, then so be it. I have given long answers myself, but if the question is asking about everything and you give an answer that can easily be made into a paper, this is the wrong place for both the question and the answer. All SE is asking you is to narrow it down.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; One commenter implied that I shouldn't provide multiple answers to my own question, but I see nothing in the site help files to prohibit this. Did I really break a rule?&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; One commenter said that the sections of my essay would be viewed in random order instead of the order I intended, but I pointed out that this is not so provided a reader clicks on the &quot;oldest&quot; option at the end of the question. In any case, this seems irrelevant to whether my question is really &quot;too broad&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Multiple answers by the same author are rare, it really depends on the question and each case. Typically, there is no need for more than one answer per user, especially on a site like Linguistics. On a site like StackOverflow, this might happen since you provide two different solutions to one problem, for example using different programming languages. But here, there is no case that comes to my mind that could justify that. &#xA;&#xA;In conclusion:&#xA;&#xA; - Narrow down your question and reword the answers to fit in one. If you really don't want to lose all that material, start a Linguistics blog and you can even link to it from your answer for &quot;additional context&quot;. There was the possibility to create blogs on SE sites, but apparently it has been discontinued. If you want to create one for Linguistics SE, I won't be opposed, and on the contrary, I think it'd be a nice idea. You can try contacting SE directly and see if something can be done. Of course, this means that you should commit yourself to it.&#xA;&#xA; - Merge the answers on the other question, which doesn't seem broad to me, and that's why I'm not closing it for now. But you should merge the answers." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The question is incoherent. You ask why the letters can't be given universal names for all the Latin languages, but you also&#xD;&#xA;ask why the consonants have different names in Spanish compared to English. English is not a &quot;Latin language&quot;, so English is completely irrelevant given questions on the table. The question that you end with has a presupposition that is false. We *can* give universal names for all letters in all languages, if we have a sufficiently dictatorial government who can impose a standard and penalize transgressors. Question of the kind &quot;why can we...&quot; are always terrible, in the context of a fact-based venue of inquiry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question of why Spanish and English have different names for letters seems to presuppose that they should have the same name, and you are wondering why your presupposition is false. Why is your presupposition reasonable? It is such a common-place experience that languages differ in what words they use for X that you should *expect* the words to be different, and perhaps only surprised when they are the same.

Text="Angle brackets are used in linguistics to denote orthographical writing in a context where the distinction matters like &quot;$\langle$wh$\rangle$ is pronounced /w/ or /ʍ/  but not /hw/ in English&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, inputting angle brackets is difficult in markdown, and [this help page](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/help/formatting) is silent about them. Naively entering them with &quot;greater than&quot; and &quot;less than&quot; signs leads to disappearing text (`&lt;wh&gt;` is rendered &lt;wh&gt;) because they are interpreted as some non-existent XML tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: Is there a simple method of entering angle brackets here (I can pick some angle bracket out of a Unicode table, but I do **not** consider this a simple method)? Can this method be documented in the help center?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S. Of course, LaTeX support would help here, as this question demonstrates." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I *think* is has to do with the fact that moving a question from site to site is thought to require a special skill set which is different from the skill set needed for topic-specific technical evaluation. Basically, it calls for skills at moderation, and not everybody should be allowed to do it, just as not everybody should be given a diamond hammer. That is, you need to not just be able to say &quot;This doesn't belong here&quot;, you have to be able to say &quot;This belongs there&quot;, and to do that with great restrint. I am betting that it only takes a single moderator action to migrate a question (and a single moderator action to reject a migration).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also suspect that the programming needed to create a public &quot;vote to migrate&quot; option would be non-trivial. We don't need to agree on exactly *why* a question should be closed, because that is just supplemental information on a single conclusion: &quot;this question is closed&quot;. Migration requires a specific target, and the set of targets is open-ended – what if there are 2 votes to migrate to French, 2 to migrate to German, and 1 to migrate to Conlang? The answer is not self-evident, and significantly affects how such an option would be implemented.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

While we get a few good well-researched questions on language usage and grammar here, most aren't great.
