It is not relevant to the current sociology of the discipline.  Much as some academics would prefer that their view be given exclusive appreciation, linguistics today is a big tent which encompasses a variety of theoretical approaches.  Furthermore, it is becoming more rather than less allied with disciplines like computer science, psychology, evolutionary biology (etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will admit to being biased by my background – that of a graduate student at an institution (Penn) where the culture is heavily biases towards cooperation across disciplinary boundaries as well as traditional rifts such as those evoked by the term &quot;Linguistics Wars.&quot;  Chomsky and Labov (widely regarded as being generals of two warring armies) gave the two keynotes at a conference here last year.  Chomsky was a little down on (of all things) computational linguistics, and a few computational linguists &lt;a href=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3180&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt;.  This is far from a war, however, and I think that a large majority of professional linguists would concur in that view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question could be re-asked constructively as (e.g.) &quot;what are current trends in linguistics research?&quot;  (Edit: which I see Mitch suggested as an alternate formulation in the comments for the linked question; I probably inadvertently calqued my suggestion from his.)  There are interesting things to be said about this (new trends in computational linguistics, the &quot;experimental syntax&quot; movement, large-scale analysis of sociolinguistic data via social media...).

However, a number of the responses and commentators seemed to get stuck on the entirely reasonable interpretation of &quot;natural&quot; as being the antonym of &quot;artificial&quot; or &quot;constructed&quot;, which seems to me to refer to the historical origin of a language rather than any linguistic feature of the language.

It can be frustrating to see questions that are easily googlable, or that seem to ask for others to synthesize a complex theory/reference – which can be an undertaking even for a professional well-versed in the field.  (It is not for nothing that professors complain that teaching takes time away from their research.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I remember what it was like for me only a few years ago, and it turns out I benefited a lot from people explaining things to me slowly, clearly, and repeatedly. I think the value of this site will be in making linguistics knowledge accessible to a wider range of people. As a professional, I have conferences and journals available as avenues of communication, as well as a reputation that makes many people willing to help me out.  But non-professionals, in the main, can't just email a professor or graduate student and ask a question – they would run the risk of being ignored.  Often they don't have access to classes in linguistics, or even journal subscriptions through a university library.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I try to structure my answers to questions so as to build bridges to theoretical linguistics.  It's a risky strategy – it may not be what the asker is looking for.  But the idea that I am helping amateur linguists gain better access to the knowledge I have gained through my education is my motivation for posting here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the LaTeX SX website (another where I have been somewhat active), many people post questions with too little information about their configuration to really diagnose their problem.  The community there has developed a list of responses along the lines of &quot;please edit your question to provide information X.&quot;  (I think they even have a meta question listing standard wording for these messages.)  I would be in favor of us developing something similar here, so that if someone asks a question that seems very basic, we respond with &quot;what resources have you tried consulting, what does Wikipedia say?&quot; etc.  This may take time to solidify – at present there is a lot of enthusiasm among core community members (on both the question and answer sides of the fence); as this wanes we will see what long-term willingness there is to endure certain types of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now, though, I think we should have a light hand in closing questions that are not &quot;research-level&quot; (though we can and should be strict about non-linguistic questions), and focus on creating awareness of appropriate reference sources for in questions that seem very basic (the WALS gets cited often in answers, for example).  We can also start building a tag structure (around &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/theoretical-linguistics&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;theoretical-linguistics&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;theoretical-linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps) that accumulates questions of interest to high-level scholars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46" LastActivityDate="2011-09-24T02:05:12.683" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

If yes, then on topic.  (Note: I don't think a no answer means off topic &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, this heuristic only works one way.)  By this measure practically everything in psychology of language comes in to some degree.  For instance, tip of the tongue phenomena is regularly taught in psycholinguistics classes (in ling departments).  When I was an undergrad there was a course in the linguistics department that even focused on speech errors and related issues such as TOT, though this kind of course is less widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can come up with similar heuristics involving what is being researched in linguistics departments, too, as @Hauser suggests above in a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many answers and comments here seem to be trying to take a more theory-based approach -- does the question have bearing on linguistic theory?  This is a reasonable question to ask in all of these cases, but I don't think it is useful as a way of deciding what is appropriate for this site.  Someone above (actually it is @Hauser too), for instance, suggests that results of TOT research don't have bearing on linguistics (which I take to mean, linguistic theory).  Whether this is right and why is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; hard question to resolve for cases like this and by no means has an obvious or settled answer, I suspect if you ask 10 psycholinguists you will get 10 different answers.  It is bound up in the issue of whether you can study the grammar without studying its implementation (cf. competence vs. performance).

Simply mentioning the word &lt;em&gt;psycholinguistic&lt;/em&gt; (as in, &quot;Is psycholinguistic research done on this topic?&quot;) didn't make it an incontrovertibly on-topic question because so much of the rest of the question was concerned with reading and how our eyes and brains process printed words with spaces between them. Usually if you ask a linguist about language perception, she will assume you are talking about &lt;em&gt;aural&lt;/em&gt; perception (unless you are talking about sign language). By wording the main question the way you did, linking &lt;em&gt;printed&lt;/em&gt; words and sentences (not the central concern of linguists) to &lt;em&gt;pictures&lt;/em&gt; (also not the central concern of linguists), you all but bypassed the facet of this reading phenomenon that is relevant for linguistic research!

For example, a linguist might ask, &quot;What role do morpheme boundaries play in the phenomenon described above?&quot; or &quot;How language-dependent is this phenomenon? Do languages whose orthographies demarcate word boundaries with spaces fare better than other languages in this regard?&quot; or &quot;Has any typological research been done on this phenomenon? Is there a correlation between ease of reading scrambled words and where on the synthetic-isolating scale a language falls?&quot; The two answers provided (to date) for the question as it was originally worded actually speak more directly to these other versions of the question, bringing it more into the realm of linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="385" LastEditorUserId="385" LastEditDate="2011-10-08T03:44:26.043" LastActivityDate="2011-10-08T03:44:26.043" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The problem is that it invites opinion (or speculation) over personal experience; other than that I don't think it breaks any of the guidelines.  One suggestion I made in the original thread: Solicit personal experiences on what works and what doesn't in running linguistic discussions for laypeople.  (Perhaps nobody will have personal experiences about running a linguistics &lt;em&gt;book club,&lt;/em&gt; but I'm guessing some of us will have experience with running popular linguistic discussions more generally.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second: I suggested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/bad-statistics-what-can-we-do&quot;&gt;bad stats thread&lt;/a&gt; that we should aim to help people with practical goals if we want to strengthen the user community here.  This strikes me as a good example of that: someone has a practical goal that's related to linguistics, they have a question about how to achieve that goal, and we are in a position to give answers.  Good answers will be linguistics-related.  (It would be fine to exclude non-linguistics-related answers like &quot;Put up an ad on Craigslist!&quot; or &quot;Make sure to serve snacks!&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think it is very much in our best interest to find some way of refining or redirecting questions like these rather than simply downvoting and closing.

So much of theoretical linguistic research involves formulating hypotheses or building models based on data from a single language or a cluster of languages and then turning to analogous data in other languages to see if the original hypothesis is supported cross-linguistically or to lend credibility to the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have yet to post a question on this site, but &lt;strong&gt;this is precisely the type of question that I am most likely to bring to a forum like Linguistics SE&lt;/strong&gt;, because it is the most difficult kind of research to do systematically using other more traditional methods (i.e. it's hard to know where to look for something when your question is precisely of the form &quot;Where would I find &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&quot;!). This site provides a unique way to harness the power of an engaged community with a common interest but an incredibly diverse palette of linguistic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that one of the most powerful aspects of SE system is the flexibility built into it, which allows a &lt;strong&gt;unique culture&lt;/strong&gt; to develop organically for each specific SE site in a way that makes sense for that field. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a situation in which I'm trolling recent questions to see if there are any that I might be able to answer, and I come across one of the form &quot;Are there any languages with feature X&quot; or &quot;I'm looking for a bunch of languages with feature X&quot;, and someone has provided a perfectly acceptable answer with, say, a list of examples from three different languages. If I happen to know two more languages with the relevant feature, I'm not going to pass over the question because my list would be shorter and therefore somehow inferior. And I'm also not going to repeat the original three languages in my own answer alongside the additional two in an attempt to create a more comprehensive super-list of five languages! I'm simply going to add my answer with the two languages that I have, trusting that &lt;strong&gt;this is a &quot;the more the merrier&quot; type of situation&lt;/strong&gt;.

It wouldn't be a matter of picking the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; answer but rather acknowledging &lt;em&gt;every accurate&lt;/em&gt; answer, thereby rewarding each person who responded with helpful information for making a valuable contribution. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I believe this may currently be disallowed, but I think it would be great if whoever asked the original question could accept more than one answer as &quot;the correct answer&quot; (this may actually be a topic worthy of its own question here in Meta!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="385" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:54:11.353" LastActivityDate="2011-10-26T05:10:05.857" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The study of Ancient Greek also often falls under historical/classical studies, as many universities combine it with these sorts of courses, so people in these fields would probably also have good recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A grammar for teaching/learning a language can be quite a different thing to the types of linguistic descriptions of a language that are also called grammars. For anyone who has ever looked at most of the books on English grammar, it is clear that these sorts of books are sometimes not informed by a &lt;em&gt;linguistic&lt;/em&gt; analysis of a language's grammar (and, in the case of English at least, many of these sorts of books include things that are completely at odds with current linguistic description and instead based on arbitrary preferences of the author). While I doubt that such a separation is true for Ancient Greek, my point is that linguists are more likely to be familiar with grammatical materials that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; designed for language teaching/learning (except through their personal interest in such a thing, but this site is about professional rather than personal insights).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question were something more like &quot;Is there a comprehensive grammatical description of Language A that covers features such as X, Y and Z that I can use for a typological comparison with Language B?&quot;, I would consider the question on-topic, because it clearly seeks a linguistically-informed description for the purposes of linguistic research (and some old grammars of languages can certainly be difficult to track down or find any records of).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other places you can ask for a recommendation for materials to help you learn Ancient Greek, and which fit your criteria (places where people may be able to help you better anyway, if the shared interest is more about materials that are useful for teaching/learning rather than linguistic analysis).

I also think that the other question (Is it common to use the minor third for calling someone? ) is different. The latter question is more about the prevalence of the feature, while the closed question is about whether Italian has it. CMIIW, a good linguist probably is expected to know about linguistics features, their prevalence and distribution, but he's not expected to be able to know exactly which languages have and do not have it it. In my opinion, this is what make them different. Maybe we tend to think that the closed question is interesting because it is talking about a major European language (&lt;s&gt;not to mention @Alenanno's mother tongue,&lt;/s&gt; just kidding) and it is an interesting feature. Consider: Does Amharic have the sound /ʃ/? Is it common to use the passive voice in Bengali?

If you've been on any of the &lt;code&gt;.moderated&lt;/code&gt; newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. &lt;em&gt;Anyone&lt;/em&gt; can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question &lt;em&gt;back into review/improve mode&lt;/em&gt;. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we close a question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on &lt;em&gt;problems you face&lt;/em&gt; or things you are trying to understand. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask&quot;&gt;don't ask&lt;/a&gt; section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some questions belong elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, &lt;em&gt;broadly speaking&lt;/em&gt; true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is closing like deletion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the requirements for closing a question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have 500 reputation on the site currently, or 3000 reputation on a graduated site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is &lt;em&gt;your site&lt;/em&gt;. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are moderators different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, so how does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example close button&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Close vote reasons dialog&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&quot; alt=&quot;Other votes&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other options are straight out closes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&quot; alt=&quot;Close banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does vote to re-open work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png&quot; alt=&quot;Re-open link&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if I make a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually there are two tools for this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/a&gt;. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes.

Commonly referred to as the &quot;10k tools&quot;, this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page.

The question was actually good (the subject) but it was vague and not so well-asked, besides the OP showed really no interest on improving it. (If the OP comes back and improves it, I can reopen it, assuming it will fit SE's and our standards.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for asking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we need to separate two things here: first, the subject of the question and second, the question itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject/Topic&lt;/strong&gt;: I think most would agree but I'd like everybody to confirm or not that the topic of the question is actually &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interesting for those who have studied Linguistics. Take the &amp;quot;false friends&amp;quot; for example. They're interesting for us, so why wouldn't a &lt;em&gt;whole sentence&lt;/em&gt; that works as a false friend be interesting as well?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other situations, the question would have been prompting for list questions, and this one is as well, but given the fact that such sentences are very rare, it might only prompt a few answers which is ok in terms of Q&amp;amp;A requirements. As a proof for this, only one answer in that question actually provides a sentence. The others just words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: The question has received downvotes and upvotes, while the answers only the latter. I could think that this is due to the fact that the question is not the best one I've seen in terms of wording and detail/context. Not to mention that the OP basically disappeared and we received no answers at all to our requests for clarifications. Maybe this is why it's getting downvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to what comes out from this Meta question and also from what comes out between me and the other mods, I'm going to either save or close the question, but you (and everyone) must know that I'm tending to decide for &lt;strong&gt;closing it&lt;/strong&gt;. Not for the topic, which is very interesting and stimulating, but for the fact that the OP didn't answer and we can't certainly edit the question without being aware of his/her real original intention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I addressed all of the points, but if there is something I missed, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="111" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-17T09:49:25.440" LastActivityDate="2012-02-20T18:30:52.923" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Tags are only placed on questions for this reason - a tag is meant to identify what the &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; is about. The main reason a question may get an answer that introduces a new technology or concept is because the question author may not have known of its existence, its name, or that it was effective for the desired purposes. As such, users who would have the same question or are in the same boat would not look for that term, because they don't know what the solution is. That's why they're searching in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question truly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about the technology or concept that is mentioned in the answers, and the author just didn't know the term (and this not-knowing part is not a core part of the original question, to boot), then it would make sense not just to update the tags, but the question as a whole. This makes the question then helpful to those who do know the matter, as it is a part of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Is it part of the question or the solution?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; This is what you should ask yourself if an answer introduces an element that you think could add a new tag. If the question is actually about that element, just not explicitly stated, then you could add it. But if the question is merely &lt;em&gt;solved&lt;/em&gt; by that new element, that doesn't make it a question about said element.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The findability of the answer is dependent on the question it is linked. If an answer of pragmatics is something that should be found because it is a solution related to pragmatics, then the question should reflect this. If the answer merely uses pragmatics to address a question that is not itself &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; pragmatics, then it and the question it is attached to should not be categorically linked to all the questions that are indeed about pragmatics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27" LastActivityDate="2012-02-27T18:40:40.190" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

From the question, it was not clear to me if he wanted to know about just these sentences, or if he was looking for good reference material to understand phrase structure trees.

Each one of us could be considered &quot;beginners&quot; in many fields, and we're still curious about some of them. I don't like the idea of answering home-work questions. I believe that people learn best when they learn the matter (with or without assistance) and apply themselves to the problem. I understand that some problems are particularly tough to solve, and some kind of group-effort would help solve it more quickly. I got the impression that this was not such a question. Quite apart from this, some lecturers prefer their assignments done independently, and some don't have any such preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alenanno indicated that it's better to discuss this on Meta.

My thoughts are that in our case, unlike StackOverflow, questions about homeworks are different, they are kind of &quot;harder&quot;. By this I mean that assignments in Linguistics are harder to understand because although Languages are quite definite systems (despite the general thinking), they are not as definite as code questions. So, it's not like asking for 1+1=2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The user also just joined us. As you can see this is not only the OP's first question in Linguistics but also the user's first question across all the SE sites: he doesn't have the +100 given to you when you join second sites. Unless he decided not to associate accounts, of course. But given that he was new at least in our site, I think we could go easy on new users. Not only because they are just starting to understand how SE sites work (which are harder than regular forums), but also because if we just start scolding people and down-voting their questions, they will be scared away and we would lose a potential good user just for a single question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I'm glad to see that other users care about the rules and not just the &quot;evil Mods&quot; :D I think that in some cases we can close an eye and help beginners to make their way. I'm not saying they're justified to do anything. But in telling them what they should or shouldn't do, we could use a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding the matter in general&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to make it clear that my opinion is to keep homework questions and not ban them. Why ban a possible resource for more questions? They can still raise interesting points, and so I think we should keep them. That been said, I also think we need to set some minimum standards, to make sure we don't get &quot;gimme teh codez&quot; questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example: Ask the OP to show some &quot;tries&quot;. We don't care if they are totally wrong. We just want to see that the OP tried to do something so we can also help more effectively on the specific problems. And if it turns out that they didn't understand anything, then we could also explain the whole thing, but still encourage for &lt;strong&gt;research effort&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what other criteria we could use, but we can certainly discuss about this.

StackExchange sites are about definite, objective answers and not about opinions, (that's why we have the &quot;subjective question&quot; close-vote), so providing reference, you're assuring the OP and the readers that what you say is true and backed up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid one-line answers&lt;/strong&gt;. It might be correct, but an answer made by a single sentence is not that informative. A bit of elaboration is very useful for the reader and for the visitors. Don't worry about being &quot;long&quot;: every information you think that can be useful for the others to know will always be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be kind to other users&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're writing a question, remember that you're asking to be helped, so make sure to show your appreciation to the ones who answer by being kind. If you're answering, instead, don't attack the OP and don't be aggressive; this doesn't mean you can't question/challenge other answers or the question. The point is that being tactful would help to face the discussion in a smoother and better way. It won't bring any good to the site to just attack other people, especially being personal. Like they say &lt;em&gt;&quot;treat others as you wish to be treated&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citations&lt;/strong&gt;. When you cite a paper/article, don't just post a raw link. Please provide the title and the author(s). For example: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Title&quot;&lt;/em&gt; by [author]. You get the idea. Providing citation is also useful in case the subject is not widely known. But we encourage citations regardless of the subject being famous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="111" LastActivityDate="2012-04-27T11:32:01.093" CommentCount="1" CommunityOwnedDate="2012-04-27T11:32:01.093" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Some linguists use fake model languages in experimental linguistics, e.g. having subjects learn a few words of a fake language and observing how the people answer questions about it.  These intersections are probably not big enough to warrant merging the conlang proposal and the linguistics SE for the reasons above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the taxonomies that stack exchange uses to divide up human knowledge is imperfect, but they have a difficult task. SE alternative would be to allow all SE sites to become yahoo answer style sites, where everyone can ask anything, and from listening to the StackOverflow podcasts, it was a conscious decision by the sites founders to avoid any-thing-goes question sites.  The down side of this is that some questions (like on conlnags) have no place to be asked and have a really hard task of getting enough followers to start a stack exchange style Q &amp;amp; A site for conlangs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, there are conlang Shapado sites out there, and there is the SE conlang proposal.

You can find a list of the team members on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/about/team&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange's team page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;2. What is the job of a diamond moderator?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are regular members of the community that have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help ensure that the community's issues are properly and promptly addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;Diamond moderators essentially serve as human &quot;exception handlers&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the efforts of other users who have earned moderation privileges, diamond moderators will also step in to help keep the site in order. Most of the time, moderators respond to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/&quot;&gt;flags from community members&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All diamond moderators must accept the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement&quot;&gt;moderator agreement&lt;/a&gt;, which essentially states that they must only use their abilities (including access to confidential information) for the good of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;3. What special privileges do diamond moderators have?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They have access to all the abilities of &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges/trusted-user&quot;&gt;trusted users&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of their reputation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Their votes are binding. Any place where users with sufficient privileges can vote—close, open, delete, undelete, spam/offensive, migration, etc.—a diamond moderator's vote is binding and the action takes effect immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can lock posts. Locked posts cannot be voted on, commented, or changed in any way.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can protect questions. Protected questions cannot be answered by anonymous and very new users, and are used to help keep down spam.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can see more data in the system, including general vote statistics (but not specific voting information for individual users or posts) and user profile information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can view all deleted posts on an individual user's profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can place users in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/&quot;&gt;timed suspension&lt;/a&gt;, and delete user accounts if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can perform large-scale maintenance actions such as merging questions and tags, tag synonym approvals, question migration to any other site in the network, and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can apply special moderator-only tags on the meta site, which appear in red.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can convert a post into &quot;Community Wiki&quot; status, or convert an answer into a comment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can (at their discretion) refund and cancel a bounty.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can merge user accounts when requested.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;4. How do we get the attention of a diamond moderator?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways. &lt;strong&gt;The most common way is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/&quot;&gt;flag the offending post&lt;/a&gt; for attention&lt;/strong&gt;. Flags show up in a special queue that is visible only to moderators. This is one of the primary ways that you help us improve the site, so &lt;strong&gt;any time you see something bad happening, please use your flags!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that in addition to the canned or stock reasons that appear in the mod flag dialog, &lt;strong&gt;you can also select the &quot;other&quot; option and type a custom message&lt;/strong&gt;. This is useful for unusual cases where, for example, you want to report a systemic problem with a particular user. Since you can only flag posts (and not users), just pick one of their posts and explain the problem in a custom flag message.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But please &lt;strong&gt;remember that not all flags are acted upon&lt;/strong&gt;! It is up to the discretion of the moderator who processes your flag whether they will take the action you suggest. There are essentially three options: they might agree with your flag and do precisely as you suggest, they might agree with your flag but think some other intervention is indicated, or they might disagree with your flag and think no action is warranted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The decisions made on flags that you have raised are visible in your flagging summary. To view that, click on the number displayed next to the &quot;helpful flags&quot; field in your user profile. Don't let it get you down if a few of your flags are marked &quot;declined&quot;. That's just our way of keeping track of the actions that we take. You only need to be worried that you might be doing something wrong if the &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of your flags have been declined (as opposed to marked as &quot;helpful&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other way to contact a moderator is to &lt;strong&gt;post a question here on the Meta site&lt;/strong&gt;. This is likely to be overkill for most purposes, and is mainly used when you want to seek the opinion of the larger community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that &lt;strong&gt;while moderator flags are private, posts on Meta are public&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, if you might be disclosing sensitive information or making inflammatory accusations against other users, you should probably limit yourself to raising a flag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;5. How are the diamond moderators chosen? Can I become one?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current set of moderators are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;pro tempore&lt;/em&gt; moderators&lt;/a&gt;; that is to say, they are not elected, but rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/200/111&quot;&gt;picked and appointed by Stack Exchange staff members&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the usual practice prior to a site graduating from public beta, as there are often not yet enough established community members to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/&quot;&gt;vote in an election&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until the site officially launches and a community-wide election is held, there is no mechanism in place for appointing new moderators. In the mean time, you can help improve the site (and help out the diamond moderators) by &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/privileges&quot;&gt;earning and exercising moderation privileges&lt;/a&gt;. You earn privileges by gaining reputation—in other words, by contributing high-quality questions and answers!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;6. What can I do if I disagree with the action(s) taken by a diamond moderator?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators are only human, and &lt;em&gt;they do make mistakes&lt;/em&gt;! If you think we've made an error in responding to one of your flags, &lt;strong&gt;the easiest thing to do is re-flag the post again&lt;/strong&gt;. The second time around, it's probably best to use the &quot;other&quot; field to provide a custom comment that explains your rationale a bit more clearly—we probably just didn't catch onto your concerns the first time around. You can also use this field to ask a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; moderator to process your flag, in the unlikely event that you think that one is biased against your concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's something a bit more complicated/subjective (perhaps something that would be better discussed by the community at large), or you've already flagged it twice, then &lt;strong&gt;you should post a question about it here on Meta&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember to include &lt;em&gt;all relevant information&lt;/em&gt; in your question, such as a link to the post in question and your exact concerns. The other moderators and community members who didn't/can't see your flag need to know what you're talking about in order to adequately discuss your concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the unlikely event that you're &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; not happy, even after bringing the issue to Meta and soliciting the opinion of the larger community, then &lt;strong&gt;you have one final recourse: you can escalate the issue to the moderators' bosses&lt;/strong&gt;. Community moderators are held accountable to and by the Stack Exchange staff. Therefore, if you truly believe that a moderator has abused his/her privileges, you can send an email to &lt;strong&gt;team+linguistics@stackexchange.com&lt;/strong&gt;, or alternatively you can post a question on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;global Meta site for the entire Stack Exchange network&lt;/a&gt;. But you really do need to discuss it &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; on the Linguistics Meta first. If you skip that step, your complaints elsewhere are less likely to be taken seriously and you may simply end up being pointed here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Thanks to Cody Gray for the elaboration of this answer: &lt;a href=&quot;https://philosophy.meta.stackexchange.com/a/374/1768&quot;&gt;Philosophy SE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="111" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:54:11.353" LastActivityDate="2012-05-17T11:24:18.540" CommentCount="0" CommunityOwnedDate="2012-05-17T10:56:04.303" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

So if we've defined &quot;linguistics&quot; in such a way that Damin and Ge'ez are ruled out, then I'd argue we've &lt;em&gt;got the wrong definition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My sense is that the descriptivist/prescriptivist line is the right one to use.  This would have the consequence that we'd have to accept descriptivist questions about Esperanto.  But I don't see the harm there.  If someone has a legitimately descriptive question about Esperanto &amp;mdash; for instance, &quot;Which word order do real-world Esperanto speakers use most in spontaneous face-to-face conversation&quot; &amp;mdash; then I'm totally fine with that.  (And honestly I think most working linguists would be too.  If a student in my department wanted to do fieldwork at Esperanto conventions for their dissertation, I don't think anyone would bat an eye.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real problem with Esperanto is that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; discussions about it &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; descriptivist.  The question most commonly discussed isn't &quot;As a matter of descriptive fact, how do Esperantists actually talk?&quot; but rather &quot;How &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; Esperantists talk?&quot; and &quot;Why is Esperanto &lt;em&gt;better than&lt;/em&gt; Lojban?&quot; and so on.  We should definitely exclude &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; questions.  But we would exclude those questions even if they were about natural languages: &quot;How should Anglophones talk?&quot; and &quot;Why is English better than Spanish?&quot; would be deleted just as quickly.  For that matter, &quot;Why is Damin better than Lardil?&quot; would be deleted.  It's a single consistent standard we can apply across the boad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if a conlang has &lt;em&gt;never had&lt;/em&gt; a substantial community of human speakers, then you can't do real linguistics on it, because there's no human verbal behavior there to study.  Even if a conlang does have human speakers, discussing its written grammar isn't linguistics, because it's focusing on a prescribed standard rather than on actual usage.  But if someone wanted to know, like, &quot;As a matter of descriptive fact, how do Klingon speakers at sci-fi cons tend to articulate the phonemes /q͡χ/ and /q/?&quot; then I'd be perfectly happy to see discussion on that point.

It seems like a lot more traffic could be brought in by allowing questions that encourage discussion. I use SO, SU, ELU, MathSE, CompSciSE, and LingSE for all questions specific to these topics, but for every other topic, I use Quora. Now, they have a much different setup than SE, namely one that allows &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind of question, including extremely subjective ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've all heard the saying &quot;Never talk about religion or politics&quot; because it can always start an argument, but the funny thing is, on Quora, even a question like &quot;What's the best religion?&quot; doesn't cause problems. These sorts of online Q&amp;amp;A communities mostly have intelligent users that aren't going to be offended by others' views like that. On that particular question, every answer was a long, detailed explanation of their own religion and why the answerer's belief system worked for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A system that allows subjective questions would certainly be viable on a site like Linguistics StackExchange. Imagine is someone asked &quot;What's the easiest language for a native English speaker to learn?&quot; If this question stipulated that respondents must cite reasons why, I'm sure there would be 5 or 6 answers with detailed explanations as to why an English speaker's mind would be able to absorb a particular language easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to note here is that this sort of question would &lt;strong&gt;bring in traffic&lt;/strong&gt;.

What could I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you honestly think your question was closed wrongly and that it should be reopened, your best bet is Meta. Some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't just post a rant, that won't help you (as in any other situation in life);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write constructively about why you think it should have stayed open, the reasons. Expose them in your question in a clear manner. That alone will grant you more positive attention even if we don't agree.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it turns out that your question deserved to be closed, accept it and move on. It happens to everybody sooner or later, nothing to be angry about: life is too short for this kind of stuff. In turn, ask if and how you could improve it, the community will certainly help. Alternatively, if nothing works out, consider posting in the Chat: there you can talk about anything that might not work here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What should I not do?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you seriously want your question to be reopened, don't act immaturely. Don't insult moderators or fellow users: they don't deserve it and that's only going to ruin your chances (even in the case you truly had). It's not going to help you. It never helped other users. No reason to make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, don't go serially downvoting other people's posts just because they closed your question: actions must be taken &lt;strong&gt;on the posts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;not on the users&lt;/strong&gt;. We are not judging you by closing your question, we are judging your question. Not to mention that this will be seen, your serial downvoting reversed and your account probably suspended; &lt;strong&gt;that's not worth it&lt;/strong&gt;. Besides, even moderators get their question closed sometimes; and yes, they stay closed sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators and other users, all of us are human beings, and as such, &lt;strong&gt;we all make mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;. So, yes, we can close a question wrongly. We're not robots. If you seriously think a moderator is abusing the powers, email the team using the link you find at the bottom of the page. Remember, however, that normally, moderators do what they think is right. Unless they're abusing, moderators do what they are supposed to do: moderate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when it happens that your question gets closed, don't post rants in the comments and then disappear. Your question will be deleted sooner or later if you don't do something about it, so why not give it a try and fix it? &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/248/111&quot;&gt;Closure is not a permanent state, but it's up to you&lt;/a&gt; if it'll be or not.

They comment in answers, they include parts of the answers in their questions, etc. There are also some more intentional reasons that make some users troublesome but luckily they're not all like that. In any case, I'll try to cover all cases. This is more intended as a guideline, rather than hard rules, but I suggest we all try to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, read: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/08/stack-exchange-is-not-a-forum-the-role-of-niceness-on-a-qa-site/&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange is not a forum: the role of “niceness” on a Q&amp;amp;A site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Be nice and friendly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Always, always be nice. Well this is actually a rule in the FAQ so, you might say &quot;hey there's nothing new there!&quot;. But being nice (or rather, &lt;em&gt;nicer&lt;/em&gt;) to new users is even more important. We don't really want to scare them away, do we? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how can we be friendly? Well, you don't need acrobatic wording, but a &quot;Hello xxx and welcome to our site!&quot; is the best way to start. It's not enough, but it's a start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Never attack the user&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By this, I mean never say things like &quot;What is this crappy question?&quot; et similia. It's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to help. Even the most well-behaved person will feel bothered by that. Use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt; that is valid in all life situations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Be patient&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than being extenuating, communicating with new users can be frustrating if they refuse to cooperate. Be patient with them. This doesn't mean &quot;let them walk over you&quot;. Don't be submissive, but certainly don't attack back: that's not going to help. Ignore personal attacks (i.e. don't answer, but &lt;strong&gt;flag them&lt;/strong&gt;) and always answer with facts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A: You are all against me, this site sucks!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  B: No, look, we are not targeting you on purpose. The FAQ says that...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they're serious users, they will apologize and start cooperating. If they're trolls (that is to be decided case by case, there rarely is a clear-cut situation), they will end up being suspended in order to let the community live in peace. Don't feed the trolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Provide resources&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Has the matter being treated in the FAQ? Did we talk about it in a Meta question? &lt;em&gt;Link them to it.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Suggest fixes or edit it yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voting to close is your right and also your duty. Moderators, when applicable, leave the new user time to fix the question before closing it. In some high-visited sites this is technically impossible, but in small sites, it's possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As high-rep users, you can vote to close, but don't hesitate to leave a comment suggesting the OP fixes to improve the question and make it fit. &lt;em&gt;Close votes expire after a while&lt;/em&gt;, so even if you voted to close and the OP fixed the question, all is well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question can be easily fixed by you, &lt;em&gt;do it&lt;/em&gt;. You have the privilege to edit for a reason. Even if low rep, do it, someone else will revise your edit and approve it if it actually improves the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If their answer is short, ask for some explanation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asking &quot;Please make it longer or we are going to delete it&quot; is kind of intimidating and might put off people, but it's the truth. So there are two ways to do this. You could use a pro-forma comment (this is mine):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Welcome to (site)! Usually we prefer longer and more elaborated answers on short answers. If you can improve your answer by adding detail, context, examples, and backing up with references, this would increase your answer's quality. Poor and/or repetitive answers risk being down-voted and subsequently removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It says the same thing, but look at the wording! :D Another way is ask for an explanation on something. Like&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Welcome to (site)! You didn't treat enough about this point and it looked interesting, mind to expand on it? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or similar wordings.

There are a lot of other interesting ELU-related things it would be nice to know where to find the tools for, too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, given this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yes of course the car whose headlights were off was running is right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can use the &lt;strong&gt;CMU Link Grammar Parser&lt;/strong&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/submit-sentence-4.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the CGI form here&lt;/a&gt; to generate this parse:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(S Yes&#xA;   (S (PP of course)&#xA;      (S (NP (NP the car)&#xA;             (SBAR (WHNP whose headlights)&#xA;                   (S (VP were&#xA;                          (PRT off)))))&#xA;         (VP was&#xA;             (VP running is&#xA;                 (ADVP right)))))&#xA;   .)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, another approach is to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chaoticity.com/dependensee-a-dependency-parse-visualisation-tool/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DependenSee visualization tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to generate a PNG of the dependency graph of a given sentence using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Parser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like this for that same sentence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/3nvZU.png&quot; alt=&quot;dependency graph of sample sentence&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please add a separate answer for each tool, and include both the link and a small demo of what that tool is good for.

I'm inspired by a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/11269/how-do-i-deal-with-an-infinitive-verb-in-a-syntax-tree&quot;&gt;tree question&lt;/a&gt;, where the post proposes a tree and asks for specific correction (what &quot;to&quot; is). The question does not literally request people to make a tree, but it could be seen as a variant of such a request (such questions are sometimes closed, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/9297/is-this-tree-diagram-correct&quot;&gt;&quot;Lucy reported that scientists wonder if the medicine will work&quot;&lt;/a&gt;). The above-mentioned reasons are half about title problems, and I don't understand what the real issue is there. The statement &lt;em&gt;There's no intuitive way to title them so they all end up as variations of &quot;Syntax tree problem&quot;&lt;/em&gt; is ambiguous. Does that mean &quot;title them in such a way that they...&quot;, or &quot;title them, and therefore they...&quot;. There's an underlying presupposition about titles that I'm not getting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main feature of tree-drawing questions which I find most useless is something that extends to various other questions not even about syntax, namely the class of &quot;please do my homework&quot; questions. That class of questions seem to really meet the objection of there being little chance that the question will ever help anyone but the OP, and it seems to me that &quot;do my homework&quot; questions themselves should be banned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the third objection is a particularly relevant one, but it should be more general and also more explicit. In the case of &quot;Lucy reported&quot;, there is no discernable general question, whereas in the question about the infinitive complementizer, there is, and the questions could even have been phrased as &quot;what label immediately dominates infinitival 'to'?&quot;. Thus, on-topic questions should transparently generalize to some class of linguistic phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, closing vs. not closing questions about syntax trees depends on how some number of readers feel about a question, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/6812/help-with-syntax-trees&quot;&gt;&quot;Ginny thinks Harry is dreamy&quot;&lt;/a&gt; question does in my opinion satisfy the desideratum of generality (it asks about the status of be-Adj phrases and whether be is a &quot;verb&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My reason for posting this answer is to try to create a bit more guidance for posters, so that people will better understand what kinds of questions to not post, and why. The help center partially defines &quot;on-topic&quot; via 4 &quot;and not&quot; conditions, one of them being &quot;Please make me a syntax tree&quot; which points to this question.

There is a specific point about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/529/should-we-make-questions-about-specific-syntax-trees-off-topic&quot;&gt;&quot;Not 'Please make me a tree'&quot;&lt;/a&gt; rule which I raise in my answer, the gist of which being that I don't think it is clear enough what constitutes a what-not-to-do. It was suggested that I raise the broader question. I find the guidance a bit too minimal, especially in terms of giving functional explanations for the guidelines that would allow users to better filter and frame their questions. My underlying assumption is that people will better understand what to do if they know why that's what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One question is whether &quot;do my homework for me&quot; questions should be allowed. IMO, they should not be: and we should say so. However, there is nothing in the help center (&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/tour&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;on-topic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask&quot;&gt;dont-ask&lt;/a&gt;) that suggests that this place &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; among other things a free answer-giving service. On-topic starts by saying who LSE is for, but not what purpose it serves. This was pointed out as the second point in &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/209/about-questions-salvaging&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; meta-discussion. The off-topic list stipulates that syntax trees, translation, and foreign-language learning help are out, but no reason is given (it also fails to include &quot;language identification&quot; questions). I would exclude such questions as having no general value -- knowing that Իմ անկյուն ցավում է is Armenian or that it means &quot;My elbow hurts&quot; is not a fact which can be applied to any other scientific linguistic inquiry. IMO, a question should be about something conceptual and general. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a discussion of homework questions &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/313/is-it-a-good-idea-to-encourage-answering-home-work-questions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I don't see any support for answering people's homeworks for them. Some of the points raised in that discussion are that questions about homeworks should show signs of &quot;making an effort&quot;, and that in principle, such questions might indirectly point to a question of general interest, so &quot;How do you draw 'I want to go home'?&quot; might lead to a question whether &quot;go home&quot; is a VP, but it also might lead to a question about S dominating &quot;to go home&quot;. Might in principle, eventually, but doesn't, when framed as &quot;How do you draw this tree&quot; (there are analogous issues in phonology, morphology, historical etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that we should explicitly say &quot;Do not ask us to do your homework for you&quot;, while admiting that homeworks can &lt;em&gt;lead to&lt;/em&gt; appropriate questions. Then we should relate homeworks to what a good question is, specifically saying something to the effect that in answering a homework, you may discover that you don't know a specific think about the problem, like you don't know how to employ the concepts &quot;phoneme&quot; versus &quot;contrast&quot; in your answer, and this leads to a more general question -- the question that you should ask -- of what the difference is between these concepts. This would be a good (enough) question because the answer applies to any number of specific instances. We should relate homeworks to the desideratum of &quot;showing some effort&quot;, saying something like &quot;explain what part you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; understand, and what alternatives you are considering&quot;, though I would frame this in terms of providing context, to which we should add &quot;Make clear your framework assumptions&quot;, since analysis questions have many answers, depending on whether you're doing Categorial Grammar, Minimalism, Classical Aspects (anybody??), HPSG, LFG, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my suggestion is that we need some higher-level (help center) identification of the purpose of the site, and some elaboration of why asking for homework answers, translations and language identification is contrary to that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{ADDENDUM}&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/11323/determining-underlying-representation&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a recent example of someone asking for a solution to a phonology problem, and an exemplar of what should be off topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:54:11.353" LastActivityDate="2017-07-13T19:57:49.617" Title="Can we give better guidance on questions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

General use of Google reveals that it is forgiving about word order and grammatical form, so you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; as e.g. &quot;Does Google ignore tense or person inflection on verbs; does it matter what order words come in?&quot;. These are essentially linguistic questions, though they tend to engender a &quot;Seriously, dude? Do the experiment&quot;. My toy experiment reveals the following search / count results involving collocations of rat and trap: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;rat trap = 3,220,000, rat traps = 1,140,000, rats trap = 9,610,000, rats traps = 664,000, &quot;rat trap&quot; = 494,000, &quot;rat traps&quot; = 360,000, &quot;rats traps&quot; = 7,690, &quot;rats trap&quot; = 8,780, trap rat = 21,100,000, trap rats = 9,610,000, &quot;trap rat&quot; = 66,000&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this shows that if they have a linguistic module in their box, it is screwed up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This focuses on the potential that there is something linguistic in nature about the behavior of the Google black box.

A user kindly provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackapps.com/q/3828&quot;&gt;this stack app&lt;/a&gt; to provide a fly-out keyboard, and in addition there are lots of online character pickers, such as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ipa.typeit.org/full/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://ipa.typeit.org/full/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://r12a.github.io/pickers/ipa/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://r12a.github.io/pickers/ipa/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripts.sil.org/uniipakeyboard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;SIL IPA keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that can be installed at the OS level. So to my mind the issue of how to get Unicode-encoded IPA symbols into questions and answers seems to be adequately addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is inadequate, to my mind, is the typography of IPA characters on the site. It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/35/1616&quot;&gt;suggested here&lt;/a&gt; that IPA be rendered using the existing &lt;code&gt;code formatting&lt;/code&gt; mechanism (surrounding all IPA text with backticks), and instinctively that is what I had been doing anyway, even before seeing that suggestion. It works well for isolated glyphs, but is pretty terrible even for the most common diacritics. For example: &lt;code&gt;ã&lt;/code&gt; (nasalization), &lt;code&gt;a̰&lt;/code&gt; (creaky phonation), &lt;code&gt;ḁ&lt;/code&gt; (devoicing), &lt;code&gt;a̤&lt;/code&gt; (breathy phonation), &lt;code&gt;t̪&lt;/code&gt; (dental). It's even worse when you try to use multiple diacritics, e.g.ː &lt;code&gt;n̠̥&lt;/code&gt; (retracted + devoiced).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this issue can be solved by changing the style sheet for Linguistics SE, so that either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;text enclosed in backticks is rendered with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripts.sil.org/doulossil_download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Doulos SIL webfont&lt;/a&gt; or a similarly capable typeface, or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;text &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enclosed in backticks is rendered with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripts.sil.org/charissil_download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Charis SIL webfont&lt;/a&gt; (Charis because it has bold, italic, and bold+italic faces, so it can handle the markdown formatting).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If option 2 is chosen, then obviously the convention would be to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use backticks for IPA text, in which case it could optionally be delimited in the usual ways (i.e., [square brackets] for phonetic transcriptions, /slash brackets/ for phonemic transcriptions, &amp;lt;angle brackets&amp;gt; for explicit reference to a glyph and/or its orthographic use).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of what I see on Firefox 37.0.1 on Linux:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ny3XU.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of diacritic rendering&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a second screenshot of diacritics in one of the comments (with a little shading added to make more clear the relevant parts):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/4UDwG.png&quot; alt=&quot;Another screenshot of diacritic rendering&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presumably that devoicing ring is supposed to be on the final &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, not on the &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; in &quot;etc&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1616" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:25:41.660" LastActivityDate="2015-04-26T13:29:05.157" Title="Better font for rendering IPA (esp. diacritics)" Tags="&lt;feature-request&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="10" FavoriteCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Some fonts provide spacing metrics for combining characters &quot;correctly&quot;, and some do not (i.e. Open Type vs. True Type). But the software also needs to be up to speed. So for example Word 2003 handles OTF fonts almost correctly, and Powerpoint 2003 does not (I guess Powerpoint is generally one generation behind Word). I've had similar problems where Word 2010 documents appear to me (using W 2003) as &quot;Vietnamese&quot; and combining characters -- in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; fonts -- were totally wrong (combining grave was ì and combining acute was Í or vice versa), but the same file in Open Office same era came out correct. The general rule is: apparently nobody understands how to deal with combining characters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a &quot;practical&quot; solution for you, other than experiment with changing everything you can imagine, like browsers and fonts.

I personally find that &quot;why&quot; questions have the greatest potential to generate speculative opinion answers, but &quot;what&quot; questions can also generate speculation. &quot;Why&quot; questions are special because they require an abstract theory that predicts the facts, whereas &quot;what&quot;, &quot;when&quot; and &quot;does&quot; can rely more on direct observation.

The problem I have with this question is that it’s not clear about what its purpose is, which I feel is vital for a list question. Since a complete answer is impossible (we can’t list all the words with /ɔ/), we need to know criteria for judging which answers are the most useful for the OP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, any answer will have to deal with dialects, since this is something that varies dialectically. But we don’t actually know that the main question is about dialectology. That is only one interpretation of the question. It might actually be about phonetics. The question uses phonemic slashes, true; but it refers to the &quot;/ɔ/ vowel sound&quot; as well as using the symbol &quot;/o/,&quot; which is ambiguous in the context of dialectology, and referring to &quot;open back&quot; counterparts of this vowel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a possible “worst-case scenario” where the questioner doesn’t actually care about dialectology: imagine a person is learning Italian, which has contrastive /o/ and /ɔ/, and wants to learn how to pronounce /ɔ/. This person decides to look for example words in English with [ɔ] to help them learn the vowel sound. They assume that Italian /ɔ/ is phonetically [ɔ], and English /ɔ/ is phonetically [ɔ] (an easy assumption to make, but not necessarily a safe assumption). So, they make a post asking for words with the /ɔ/ sound in English. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone responds with a list of a few sample words with the /ɔ/ phoneme, a description of lexical sets, and discussion of how members of this lexical set vary across different American dialects. This would be a great answer to a question about the dialectical phonology of /ɔ/. However, the original poster misses out on learning useful information about the phonetic details that were actually the original motivation for their question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important point about this imaginary scenario is that nobody – the original poster, the answerers, and so on – will be able to realize that the original poster was motivated by an “unsafe assumption,” and missed out on useful information. The original poster thinks that they’ve gotten the information they need, and the answerer thinks they’ve provided all the relevant information about /ɔ/ in English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this story far-fetched? Yes. But I don’t think you can disprove this story about the OP of that question, because they have not responded to anyone or clarified what their question is really about. Until that happens, or until someone decides that the OP has abandoned the question and edits it to have a clear purpose, there aren’t any objective criteria for selecting one answer as the best for that question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An idea for what to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to answer a question that was suggested to you by someone else's question, I think the best solution would be to post it as a new question. I assume it would not be closed as an exact duplicate if the original is closed for being unclear. For example, in this case, you could post and answer a question &quot;Are there differences in the distribution of the phoneme /ɔ/ across different dialects of English? If so, what are they, and what are the relevant sound-changes and cross-dialectical correspondences?&quot; I think that's sufficiently different from &quot;give me words with /ɔ/&quot; that it wouldn't be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm unsure about this suggestion, however. Perhaps it would be better to simply edit the OP's question to what you want to answer, and then see if the OP responds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5581" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:54:11.353" LastActivityDate="2015-07-09T23:12:10.530" CommentCount="9" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

People do ask specific questions about specific languages, but in a good question it's clear how to relate the specific question to something broader. Since you're talking about something made up, it wouldn't be possible for the reader / answerer to relate the specific question to the big picture. I cannot figure out what the underlying general question might be. In addition to answers being completely arbitrary, I find the question literally incomprehensible, in that I cannot identify the presuppositions or re-phrase the question to be something linguistic in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Edit]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The revision refers to a world with French spirit summoners, but there are no spirits or summoners of actual spirits, so you would need to clearly identify the hypothetical presuppositions. Questions that ask if something &quot;makes sense&quot; are often bad because they fail to explicitly identify the rational basis behind a prediction, and it would be best to reduce this to something like &quot;Does outcome X follow from the meaning of the term Q?&quot;, in which case you've directed our attention to a possible issue in semantics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an analogous question about English words: &quot;Would it make sense in American English, given the meaning of &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;pig&quot;, if cows were never called 'pigs'? Or would you expect cows to always be called 'pigs'?&quot; I'm not trying to mock your question, I'm trying to strip away the confusing presuppositions and reduce the question to its logical bare bones. Basically, it follows from the conventional meaning of &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;pig&quot; that the things called pigs are not cows, and vice versa, so as long as people use words according to convention, then you predict that people won't call cows 'pigs'. More sophisticated semantic questions could probe the relationship between &quot;penguin&quot; and &quot;bird&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a paraphrase of your question which IMO is better (but maybe totally misses your intent), though I don't claim that it is good. &quot;In a literary context that has witches (or whatever) who summon spirits, would it follow from the meaning of the term &quot;Familiar Spirit&quot; and the assumed nature of such spirits that they are never called &quot;Familiar Spirits&quot;; or would you expect them to always be called &quot;Familiar Spirits&quot;. My paraphrase switched from French to English (was there something about the French term that was crucial?), and I got rid of the difference between &quot;summoned spirit&quot; and &quot;familiar spirit&quot; (is that a technical distinction? If so, it needs explanation). Unfortunately, this paraphrase is like the &quot;calling cows 'pig'&quot; question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question can only be answered by someone who is intimately familiar with fantasy writing practices in French and is about stylistic norms, I'd say that the question is totally off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Edit2]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the &quot;unicorn&quot; information, it seems that the kind of question that you're asking about is the probability of a particular term being created to refer to some thing, especially when the term is historically or synchronically composed of identifiable parts. An example would be &quot;Since the marionberry was tested in Marion County by George Waldo (who worked in Benton County), from the Chehalem and Olallie blackberries, is it most likely that the berry would be called 'marionberry', rather than 'Georgeberry', 'Waldoberry', 'Chehelallieberry'?&quot; or &quot;Logan Blackberry&quot;? Certain possibilities could be ruled out on linguistic grounds, like &quot;Bbery&quot; (pronunciation) and it turns out for the same reason &quot;Chehelallieberry&quot; (for reasons having to do with stress conflicts and &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;), but the remainder are equally likely from a linguistic POV. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While linguists are generally aware of the source of the component parts &quot;uni-&quot; and &quot;-corn&quot; and might, given some elementary knowledge of medieval culture be able to see a reason for &quot;unicorn&quot; over &quot;onehorn&quot;, that's just not doable in the case of &quot;Familier&quot;. The question might be suitable for a site on literary history, because the heart of the question is &quot;what were the real-world circumstances surrounding the historical association of this word with that concept, centuries ago&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastEditorUserId="6726" LastEditDate="2015-07-16T19:13:03.860" LastActivityDate="2015-07-16T19:13:03.860" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

  <row Id="639" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2015-08-13T22:53:04.423" Score="6" ViewCount="902" Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the 3 custom reasons for closing a question is the “Language-specific” property, expressed in the check-box item “Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage”. IMO closing questions on this grounds is “unfair” because it is not enumerated in the “and is not about” list (advice or help on learning a foreign language; translation requests; trees; things not about linguistics). Nor do I think that you can reasonably infer that language-specific grammar and usage questions are “not about linguistics”, based on the “is about” list. One can conclude that Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic if one has enough reputation to close questions and have actually tried to close a question and encounter this reason; or if you keep track of currently-visible closed questions and see this reason. But I don’t think that is a reasonable requirement for knowing what is off-topic, given that we could simply fix the help center to mention this basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A dozen questions were closed over the past 90 days on this grounds. An example of a question closed on this basis is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12820/if-two-verbs-are-in-a-row-is-the-first-always-an-auxiliary&quot;&gt;2-verbs question&lt;/a&gt;, which asks if having 2 consecutive verbs (in English) means that the first is an auxiliary. The question does not ask about a causal linguistic explanation, it just asks if this is a correct generalization, and it is only about English. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One inference you could make about the “Language-specific” restriction is that questions about a specific language are off-topic. If that is the intent, then we do a poor job of closing questions, because very many questions that don’t get closed are about single languages. Some recent examples (I’m not proposing that these should be closed) are &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13062/what-accent-for-the-english-language-is-most-widely-and-easily-understood&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13082/north-american-english-r-muscles-and-linguistic-description&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/13073/is-the-prefix-proto-reserved-only-for-unattested-languages&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. These questions do not clearly invoke a scientific linguistic issue (whereas the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/11373/interrogatives-and-copulas-in-malay&quot;&gt;Malay copula question&lt;/a&gt; is more clearly “concerned with linguistics”). Based on actual patterns of question non-closure, I surmise that a question about a single language which does not have a discernible theoretical linguistic agenda is not per se off topic. I do not know what a ban on language-specific grammar questions is supposed to achieve, and I don’t see how the targeted question-askers could understand what they are not supposed to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The “unless” clause (“unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage”) of this closure-ground is also puzzling, since “linguistics” vs. “usage” is a false dichotomy. Not everything is either “about linguistics” or “about usage”, and I do not see what “rather than usage” contributes. The 2-verbs question is basically about a grammatical generalization, though not expressed in terms of any theory of syntax, but it is not about “usage”, at least in any meaning of “usage” that I have ever encountered. I have no idea what kinds of bad things are supposed to be excluded by not allowing questions about usage. Is this code for questions with prescriptive presuppositions (and if so, why do we not simply make clear what our ideological stance is regarding normative topics, even scientific (sociolinguistic) ones?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example of a “language-specific” question is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12911/what-is-the-difference-between-creativity-and-productivity&quot;&gt;&quot;productivity&quot; question&lt;/a&gt; which basically asks whether the semantics of “productivity” and “creativity” are the same. In this case, I can see a connection between the question and “usage”, since this is a referential question about semantics, asking whether the extension of the terms is identical (though not using such a fancy term as “extension”). A dumb way to ask whether “cat” and “dog” have the same semantic properties is to ask if they can be felicitously used the same way. I would not have assumed that a question asking about the referential properties of two words is about “usage”, and this is certainly not a violation of any anti-normativity question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closure of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/12958/what-connects-and-explains-the-many-meanings-of-yet&quot;&gt;&quot;yet-history&quot; question&lt;/a&gt; about the historical semantics of English “yet” is likewise puzzling, since it asks about multiple languages (I don’t speak Old English or Middle English but I do speak Modern English, therefore these are not the same language).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the question part. First, can someone explain the intent of the sentence “Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage”. Second, can we make the help center accurately reflect that intent?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Addendum]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding questions of the type &quot;Do I use on or in with verb X?&quot;, there are a number of ways such a question might be posed (applied to &quot;stand ___ line&quot;, in English). Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should I say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In Standard English, do you say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do English speakers usually say 'Stand in line' or 'Stand on line'?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In English, does the verb &quot;stand&quot; select &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on&quot; before &quot;line&quot; as a complement?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first phrasing is explicitly normative, and the other three are descriptive, thus in some minimal way linguistic. Is it just the first version that should be avoided, or all three? Also, note that I'm only asking about questions that are to be closed, not ones that can be migrated to a different SE site. A valid dichotomy would be between descriptive questions and normative questions. Does it accomplish the intent of the &quot;Language-specific&quot; restriction to say that all normative questions are off-topic? The first version of the question would be OT given that. The other versions of the question ask for factual information. Since &quot;Standard English&quot; is not a well-defined object, the second version of the question would really run afoul of the opinion-based restriction, though applied to some other language with an actual codified standard, there could be such a thing as a correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:54:11.353" LastActivityDate="2019-11-04T15:19:01.707" Title="What is the meaning of &quot;Language-specific grammar and usage questions are off-topic unless primarily concerned with linguistics rather than usage&quot;" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;off-topic-questions&gt;&lt;close-reasons&gt;" AnswerCount="4" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

By analogy, a question asking for references on Indo-European historical linguistics would generate a huge number of replies. Narrowing it down to &quot;the best introduction&quot; would help -- one might consider &lt;em&gt;Outline of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic Languages&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Proto-Indo-European Phonology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Proto-Indo-European Syntax&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics&lt;/em&gt;, but probably not &lt;em&gt;New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Introduction to the Laryngeal theory&lt;/em&gt;.

I have no idea what use that information would be to you, though. The quotes from textbooks simply reflect reification of IPA transcriptional practice. An affricate has a complete closure (&quot;a stop&quot;), and there is a significant release sequence. There are different theories of that later aspect, one being the &quot;Dummies&quot; definition which just stipulates the stop-plus-fricative sequence theory (incorrect, in light of Polish stop plus fricative clusters as in [t ʃɨ] vs affricates as in [tʃɨ]), and the Demers et al. definition which points obscurely to the SPE characterization (&quot;releasing secondarily into a fricative&quot;, overly reifying the consequences of the speed of the release, which SPE sees as being only &quot;similar to a fricative&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;separation between the stop and fricative&quot; is not a primary fact about the meaning of the term, it is an artifact of particular contemporary ideologies about affricates. You should focus on the meaning (and ideology) surrounding the first use of the word &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; linguistic term, in the mid 19th century (as far as I know), which requires knowing who coined the term, and what they were thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your question unreasonably assumes that there &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a regular and obvious relationship between the wording of the definition for a technical term in a modern textbook, and the much earlier Latin source. This is contrary to the nature of arcane nomenclature, where you have to know the circumstances surrounding first use (e.g. why is the J(/psi) meson called &quot;J&quot;?). The semantic leap from &quot;rub&quot; to &quot;fricative&quot; is the same in nature as from &quot;rub against&quot; to &quot;affricate&quot;, so you should first attempt to trace these linguistic terms back as far as you can. Reading the early texts where &quot;fricative&quot; and &quot;affricate&quot; were first introduced (and knowing what impelled the replacement of &quot;spirant&quot; with &quot;fricative&quot;) is important to understanding the semantic leap in question. What term preceded &quot;affricate&quot; in linguistics, presumably in German? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastActivityDate="2015-09-25T00:26:09.930" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

My opinion is that there is already too much superfluous overspecification, such as a distinction between graphemics and graphetics; phonology and morphonology; linguistic anthropology and anthropological linguistics. Since &quot;prosody&quot; or &quot;agreement&quot; aren't explicitly mentioned in this long list, one might mistakenly conclude that questions on those areas of linguistics are considered off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am aware that a terminological distinction is made between NLP and comp-ling, and I still don't understand how NLP isn't just a subset of what is covered by CL. If you can point to a question that was closed or otherwise deprecated because it is &quot;off-topic&quot; and yet is about NLP, that might make a case for clarifying that NLP is on-topic. As I imagine you have surmised, people don't exactly stick to strict and literal interpretations of the off-topic list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to threadjack your question, but by way of comparison, I think that there is a problem with the treatment of a certain class of questions in the area of descriptive linguistics (which is not part of the explicit on-topic list), and that is when people ask questions about facts of languages, they are frequently closed as being off-topic (&quot;language-specific&quot;). These are generally not great questions anyhow, and the ones that are are contextualized in terms of a theoretical linguistic notion and not closed. It is possible that some of these questions would survive if &quot;descriptive linguistics&quot; or &quot;language description&quot; were added to the on-topic list. OTOH, anything that you would &quot;describe&quot; about a language is going to be about the syntax, phonology, phonetics, morphology, graphemics.... of the language, so already covered by an existing category.

The same problem exists for questions of Historical Linguistics for one language X; for example, most native speakers of X cannot connect an English or French Word to Proto-X as only a linguist can. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Example Question as a Test:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title:&lt;/code&gt; How else might the Latin 'torrere' have drifted semantically to mean 'rushing, roaring (of streams)'?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Question&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;amp;search=torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;[Etymonline]&lt;/a&gt; [...] from Latin &lt;em&gt;torrentem&lt;/em&gt; (nominative &lt;em&gt;torrens&lt;/em&gt;) &quot;rushing, roaring&quot; (of streams), also &quot;a rushing stream,&quot; originally as an adjective &quot;roaring, boiling, burning, parching, hot, inflamed,&quot; present participle of &lt;em&gt;torrere&lt;/em&gt; &quot;to parch&quot; (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=terrain&amp;amp;allowed_in_frame=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;terrain&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google revealed only &lt;a href=&quot;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KDuAaVDUxb8J:mittani.blogspot.com/2009/06/notes-on-etymology-of-torrent.html+&amp;amp;cd=4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;one conjecture&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So, what could be the connection between a rushing stream and something which is dried out, thirsting for some water?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Supposedly, the contrasting meanings are linked by the image of a mountain creek or river which may be a raging current in spring, but dries out in summer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somehow the above is unpersuasive, probably because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;most raging streams do not dry;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it is factually false to refer to a dried raging stream still as a `raging stream``; one would have said 'dried raging stream'.

Questions asking us to psychologize an author's motivation for using a particular word in a publication, on the other hand, are off-topic. It would be perfectly on-topic to ask how C-command is defined in syntax (as it turns out, there was an unfortunate period where the definition would change on a weekly basis, but that presumably would not be held against you). Such a question identifies a linguistic concept, and asks an objectively answerable question about what it refers to. Asking &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Clements coined that particular term to identify the concept is not a question about linguistics, it is a question about a linguist. I also would maintain that asking why linguists disagree (have different definitions, especially) is not an appropriate kind of question. From the perspective of hard sciences, it is kind of annoying that terminology becomes the invariant and the meaning of terms becomes the scientific desideratum, but that is the way it is, and when you understand that fact, then you would cease to be confused about inconsistent use of terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions which duplicate prior questions in essentials and which only change particulars of an example are also inappropriate. Once you know that semantic change is effectively random, asking &quot;how do you relate meaning meaning X to meaning Y&quot; is basically asking the same question again and again, with different specific words. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many people (here and elsewhere) have a tendency to report everything they have heard about a topic and then ask some question, leaving the reader to infer what the relationship is between the massive wall of information and the actual question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Addendum: hostility is quite distinct from frustration and even annoyance.

You should try to write it so there isn't any question about what you're asking. We often have to guess at the intended question based on the title: your title suggests the question is about historical development of languages, but the body asks about how many languages were known to exist at a certain time. The title and body should ask the same question. You include the text &quot;Aramaic etc. -&gt; Hebrew, Arabic&quot; which we can't interpret: I would &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; that you're claiming that &quot;Aramaic etc.&quot; developed into Hebrew and Arabic, which is false and meaningless given that we don't know what &quot;etc'&quot; refers to. Anyhow, that final bit of text is a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core of the question seems to be simply &quot;Is it possible to say how many languages where known at that time&quot;. There are two obstacles to answering such a question: (1) known by whom? and (2) at what time. First, you need to refer not to a biblical story, but to a concrete time period -- such as &quot;during the reign of Darius&quot; (okay, too late) or &quot;around 2,000 BC&quot;. Second, you need to contextualize the knowers – I think the answer w.r.t. the Germanic tribes is &quot;a couple&quot;, and the answer w.r.t. the average educated Mesopotamian resident is, errh, dozens, and the answer w.r.t. the handful of people who represent the pinnacle of Mesopotamian science might be a hundred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a third problem with the question, which might suggest that the question is not suited for this site, but that is not my intention. The problem is that the question almost certainly would only generate speculative opinions and not true facts. Or, it would generate the 1-word answer &quot;no&quot;. I basically made up my numbers, any the next guy can make up different numbers. The problem is that the question reads like a request to know how many languages people were aware of at a certain time, and we have next to no basis for answering that question. The bulk of your question seems to be about that; yet what you as is &quot;Is it possible to say...&quot;, which is really about research methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I would think carefully about whether you are asking a methodological question, or a historical-factual question (about actual awareness of languages), and then make the question fit your intent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastActivityDate="2016-05-03T15:05:24.800" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Both can be long or short but you're not posting an essay, you're posting an answer.

In any case, this seems irrelevant to whether my question is really &amp;quot;too broad&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multiple answers by the same author are rare, it really depends on the question and each case. Typically, there is no need for more than one answer per user, especially on a site like Linguistics. On a site like StackOverflow, this might happen since you provide two different solutions to one problem, for example using different programming languages. But here, there is no case that comes to my mind that could justify that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narrow down your question and reword the answers to fit in one. If you really don't want to lose all that material, start a Linguistics blog and you can even link to it from your answer for &amp;quot;additional context&amp;quot;. There was the possibility to create blogs on SE sites, but apparently it has been discontinued. If you want to create one for Linguistics SE, I won't be opposed, and on the contrary, I think it'd be a nice idea. You can try contacting SE directly and see if something can be done. Of course, this means that you should commit yourself to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merge the answers on the other question, which doesn't seem broad to me, and that's why I'm not closing it for now.

A question does not have to be at such a basic level such that every person on the planet will instantly understand it, but it should be possible for someone who doesn't to come to an understanding in a reasonable amount of time. Questions concerning obscure topics such as yours should be accompanied by links or citations to books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I search &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com.au/search?q=vertical+dimension+of+sentence+structure&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google for &quot;vertical dimension of sentence structure&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, the first result is your own question, which is not a good sign. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/Syntax/TheHorizontalAndVerticalDimensionOfSentences&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;second result&lt;/a&gt; doesn't seem to be about anything other than the idea that linguists draw syntax trees. Down further is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catena_(linguistics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on Catena&lt;/a&gt;, a topic in dependency grammars, which does seem similar to your answers, but it doesn't mention declensions or case which your question does. Other responses link to several books in Google Books. In none of these is it clear that they are talking about what you are asking about. For this reason it is completely appropriate that your question be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in fact, as you wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/17271/how-can-psg-describe-the-vertical-dimension-of-sentence-structure#comment41397_17271&quot;&gt;a comment&lt;/a&gt;, this concept of a &quot;vertical dimension&quot; is an original feature of your theory! I would not have a problem with someone presenting a new linguistic theory or framework in order to answer another question. But you can't ask a question &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a new theory, one which &lt;strong&gt;no one but you understands!&lt;/strong&gt; That's completely ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Answers can be 30000 characters long, or about 5000 words. Very occasionally a very detailed answer will need to be broken up into two posts, but I've only seen one or two such posts which I thought actually warranted that level of detail. Your ten answers come to just over 20000 characters. Even accounting for formatting they would fit comfortably in a single post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But posting a multi part answer is a distraction from the real problem with your question. You have a new theory, and I guess you want some feedback on it. You have in effect posted a moderate length research article here. You should not be posting it here, you should be submitting it to a journal. If you want feedback I'm sure many of our community members would be interested in reading it, so you should ask on chat for that. I'd be interested myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something like this needs to be written and formatted as a research article, with an introduction, explanation of the problem, some level of literature review, development of the new model, and arguments for why it has superior explanatory power over existing models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2555" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:54:11.353" LastActivityDate="2016-06-02T10:51:02.570" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I think questions that would be well-suited for both Language Learning and Linguistics sites would be those that ask about the broader aspects of learning languages. Few people ask such questions. And if they did, I don't think we have academics on this site who specialize in that field. I mean, sure, we have professors and former professors of linguistics, and they are likely to be better informed about language learning than lay people.

Do we refer to historical&#xA;linguistics (then I would rather use the&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/historical-linguistics&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;historical-linguistics&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;historical-linguistics&lt;/a&gt; directly), history of linguistic theory&#xA;(then we should consider renaming it to &quot;history-of-linguistics&quot; or&#xA;&quot;history-of-theory&quot; or something) or the influence of historical context on the development of languages (but this should then again boil down to&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/historical-linguistics&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;historical-linguistics&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;historical-linguistics&lt;/a&gt; or sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sociolinguistics&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;sociolinguistics&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;sociolinguistics&lt;/a&gt;)? Proposal by Alenanno: rename it to &quot;histocial-context&quot;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ancient&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ancient&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; This is not very expressive - I would rather go with more&#xA;accurate tags like &quot;ancient-greek&quot; or &quot;ancient-hebrew&quot; etc.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbol&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;symbol&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;symbol&lt;/a&gt; This is used pretty unhomogeneously. Most of these questions are about writing systems, unicode or IPA where there is already tags for&#xA;that; the rest are not really linguistic questions i.m.o. (such as a&#xA;question about emoticons). The only question with a reasonable use of the&#xA;tag I found so far is &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/15561/do-symbols-include-only-morphemes&quot;&gt;this&#xA;one&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;but looking at the other questions tagged with this tag, &quot;symbol&quot; doesn't really help classifying questions into a more or less homogeneous group of interest which makes its need questionable. Should we&#xA;delete the tag and, if necessary, change the tags of the few&#xA;remaining question to others? I would suggest using it in the context of semiotics, like in the question I linked, but then we should careful that it doesn't overlap with &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/writing-systems&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;writing-systems&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;writing-systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipa&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ipa&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ipa&lt;/a&gt; etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/marking&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;marking&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;marking&lt;/a&gt; - ambiguous again; both used as &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/markedness&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;markedness&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;markedness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/morphology&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;morphology&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;morphology&lt;/a&gt; - should we better restrict it to one meaning; if so, which one, or should we remove it completely and simply re-tag the existing four questions?  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/variation&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;variation&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;variation&lt;/a&gt; - seems to be used very unhomogeneously again - what to do with it? I'd say we use it in the sanse of language variation (dialects, sociolects, ...) - but we need an informative tag wiki then.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lexical-relations&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;lexical-relations&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;lexical-relations&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;s&gt;only three questions, one about semantics,&#xA;one about verbs, one about syntax - do we need it?&lt;/s&gt; A tag wiki has been suggested, the wrongly tagged questions removed, and more questions tagged correctly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/numbers&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;numbers&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;numbers&lt;/a&gt; is always only used in the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/numerals&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;numerals&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;numerals&lt;/a&gt; (which makes sense since this is a linguistics and not a mathematics site). We now have tag wikis so in the future they will hopefully be used appropriately, but I'm still wondering whether there is a good use for &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/numbers&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;numbers&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;numbers&lt;/a&gt; here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/research&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;research&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; - it's either about &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reference-request&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reference-request&lt;/a&gt; or any of the other tags (like research questions about English, historical linguistics etc.), so it's not really needed - or we should add a precise tag wiki&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/synatx&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;synatx&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;synatx&lt;/a&gt; - This is a typo&lt;/s&gt; removed  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I would suggest merging or synonymising a bunch of tags (is the direction relevant?):  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resources&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;resources&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resource-request&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;resource-request&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;resource-request&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/online-resources&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;online-resources&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;online-resources&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reference-request&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reference-request&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/references&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;references&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; Proposal by Alenanno: &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reference-request&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reference-request&lt;/a&gt; for essays, papers etc, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resource-request&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;resource-request&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;resource-request&lt;/a&gt; for corpora etc. - I find that a useful distrinciton.

But skimming through the questions, possibly the difference is that the former is usually rather requests for existing tools, while the latter is used for problems in creating NLP software?

I think it should be at best a synonym of &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/proper-nouns&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;proper-nouns&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;proper-nouns&lt;/a&gt;, since this is also the main tag I proposed for &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/proper-names&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;proper-names&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;proper-names&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;lemontree: If we make it synonyms, does this make sure that questions tagged &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/proper-names&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;proper-names&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;proper-names&lt;/a&gt; don't somewhere show up as &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toponymy&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;toponymy&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;toponymy&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It sounds like a meta-tag, but I'm not sure, so I may leave it for the time being.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;lemontree: It is a meta-tag, but used pretty often (5 times already only this month) so I would definitely keep it, just thuoght a more intuitive name would help new users use it.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/language-identification&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;language-identification&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;language-identification&lt;/a&gt; questions may be kept (not sure we ruled on them being banned in all cases), but I'd be strongly in favor of setting restrictions on how to handle them. In case these already exist, upgrade them.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;lemontree: I don't think existing questions should be deleted either, but maybe to prevent new questions (it's alreay said in the help center, but when users see that a tag exists they might think such questions are still okay) we could place an information to the tag wiki?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yes, should be removed. We already have &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/constructed-languages&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;constructed-languages&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;constructed-languages&lt;/a&gt; to distinguish. Linguistics is primarily about natural languages anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I may agree with Aaron's proposal &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/historical-context&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;historical-context&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;historical-context&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds like a nice substitute for &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/history&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;history&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; which seems very vague.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;lemontree: Yes, this sounds good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Agreed. It should be removed in favor of more specific tags, like the ones you suggested.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not sure about deleting it, but it needs to be seen how it could be used. The concept of symbols is not all external to Linguistics.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;lemontree: I would suggest using it in the context of semiotics, like in the question I linked, but then we should careful that it doesn't overlap with &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/writing-systems&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;writing-systems&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;writing-systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipa&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ipa&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ipa&lt;/a&gt; etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The linguistic term is &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/markedness&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;markedness&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;markedness&lt;/a&gt;, so we should delete &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/marking&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;marking&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;marking&lt;/a&gt;. It's also redundant.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;lemontree: The tag is not always used in the sense of markedness, some uses are about moprhological marking. But it's only four questions in total anyway, so we could just re-tag them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We should write a decent tag wiki to describe how to properly use it, but as a concept it is valid, so we should keep it.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;lemontree: So we should stick to a use in the sense of language variation (like dialects or sociolects)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lexical semantics is a subfield of semantics, so maybe this one might be redundant. But it's a tricky one because the concept it encompasses is huge.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;lemontree: Since it has only been used three times in total, I think it's no problem to delete it despite it being a subfield of another field. If we want to keep it, we should go with a good tag wiki or at least a better name (like &quot;lexical-semantics&quot;), because &quot;lexical-relations&quot; is a bit vague.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove, of course.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Synonym tags&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Agree&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;

One is the general range of topics that are within the scope of linguistics, and the other is whether a particular question would be on-topic here. As for the first issue, you can broadly say that linguistics is the scientific study of the nature of human language, which means describing and modelling the systems that give rise to the epiphenomenon known as &quot;Language&quot;. For example, it is a linguistic question whether in English (broadly construed) sentences can have two consecutive modal verbs: should, might, ought to... As a descriptive (scientific) fact, the answer depends on what dialect of English you are talking about. In my dialect, *&quot;We might should go&quot; is ungrammatical, but I know of other dialects where this is grammatical and fairly common. In terms of modelling, it is also a linguistic question how you might account for either of those facts – what formal feature of grammar describes those facts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A third question is the normative one, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; you say 'We might should go'&quot;. This is the epitome of a &quot;usage&quot; question (off-topic), and cannot be answered scientifically. There is no objective fact that determines what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do when it comes to language, and we only deal in &quot;can (not)&quot; and &quot;must (not)&quot; in the sense &quot;is (not) even part of the language&quot;. So a question about the actual meaning of a word could be linguistically on-topic, and could be answered with reference to objective facts. A question about what the meaning of a word &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be (e.g. whether the meaning of &quot;sofa&quot; should be different from the meaning of &quot;couch&quot;) is purely a matter of opinion, not science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any question of modelling facts presupposes a description of the facts, so obviously you can't model the &quot;difference&quot; between &quot;guess&quot; and &quot;estimate&quot; if there is no actual difference. A question of the form 'does X adequately model the difference in meaning between &quot;guess&quot; and &quot;estimate&quot;?' is meaningful and answerable (where &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; might actually be true) only if there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a difference in meaning: but there isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As pointed out in the relevant question, there may be a stylistic usage difference – but such questions are off-topic for this site (and on-topic for the English site). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastActivityDate="2017-04-19T16:39:50.833" CommentCount="9" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I also have no interest in the NLP questions that get asked here, which I think would be better suited to an NLP site because they are basically narrow programming questions, but they are allowed here.

Second, while I agree with your characterization of linguistics as including the empirical study of natural language, it also includes the theoretical study of the empirically discerned properties of NL (which is how formal language theory got invented in the first place). The epitome of high-level theory is formalization. I do agree that many such questions are better suited elsewhere, but that is because this place is not generally populated by specialists who know the linguistic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; mathematical details. Finally, as a narrow theoretician I would still maintain that there is a place for applied and methodological questions, such as how Markov models might be used in speech recognition or whether information theory has anything to say relevant to the study of meaning. So likewise, formal language questions are &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; germane to a grammarian, since theoretical linguistics has been plagued by decades of sloppy, informal thinking about what notations and conventions mean (IMO).

It mentions a piece of a song because it is the only place where I found the word used, so the song is both the background for the question and the only usage example I have right now. Should I find other examples, I will probably add them. However, the question has been closed as &quot;seeking help with identification or translation of specific samples of text&quot;. I believe that, though the question arose as such, the current phrasing should make it on-topic as a question about the etymology and semantics of a word. In other words, it is now phrased in a way that goes beyond just translating the specific bit of song. Hence, I would (with an obvious bias because I asked it) nominate it for reopening. As an example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/25779/what-is-the-etymology-of-sicilian-vanedda-and-what-does-it-mean&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;, which originates from the same song and is about another Sicilian word, has been twice upvoted and not yet closed.

On the other hand, it is a usage example of the word, and the whole reason I believe there might be another sense to it besides the name of the procession in the mentioned festival. If I had another example hinting at such a figurative sense, I would have brought that one too. Except I have none. So this is not about the song, but rather about the etymology and meaning of &quot;atturna&quot; in Sicilian, as the title states. Is it off-topic to ask about where a word comes from and what it means? Or is asking such things about a Sicilian word off-topic, whereas e.g. for an English word it is on-topic?

So that's not a case where it's not possible to answer the question. There is a separate question about the appropriateness of single-word etymologies, so we can leave this particular example. The bigger question is about the notion of a question that can't be answered. There are two existing reasons to close unanswerable questions: (1) unclear what you are asking (therefore we cannot give the answer) and (2) opinion question (again, anything you say is &quot;correct&quot;, there is no answer). Once we've excluded questions that do not have an objective answer, we have two kinds of &quot;unanswerable&quot; questions. One is the speculative unknowable question – these might in principle be closable. For example, &quot;what language phylum was spoken by the inhabitants of the Zagros Mountains in 8,000 B.C?&quot;. This does refer to an actual fact, but nobody can answer it in lieu of time travel or field work by alien linguists. Although the question does not demand an opinion &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; answer, the only responses are going to be either the observation that we can't know, or else some speculative opinion. Conceivably, such questions can be subsumed under the &quot;opinion&quot; reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another class of such questions is the set of &quot;nobody here knows&quot; or perhaps &quot;nobody has figured that out&quot; questions. The Telugu phonemic orthography question probably falls into that category, the problem being that you have to be very familiar with Telugu and Telugu phonology, plus you have to have a good grasp on terminological issues (what exactly does a &quot;phonemic orthography&quot; mean?). We often get existence questions (of the type &quot;are there any Verb-initial ergative languages?&quot;), where we don't want 100 answers saying &quot;I don't know of any&quot; (so how can we distinguish ignorance from an educated claim of non-existence?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;any case-marking signed languages&quot; question falls into this class. The problem there is that we have an answer that addresses ASL and BSL, but there are hundreds of other signed languages not reported on (e.g. TSL, KSL for Tanzania, Kenya). Again the question is whether answers should accumulate examples of &quot;not in this language&quot;. If yes, then theoretically we might draw at some point the reasonable conclusion that no SL has morphological case marking. If not, we're stuck at knowing about only two languages, unless someone comes up with an example. In other words, existence questions whose answer is &quot;no&quot; are in the neighborhood of &quot;unanswerable&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not see what adding a tag would do for us / the question. I don't understand what &quot;filtering-out&quot; needs to be done (for what purpose). Let's assume that there is a goal to have an answer to every question. Some questions can't and shouldn't be answered: unclear ones, opinion ones – these get closed. Also ones that aren't about linguistics. For the other questions, we want answers, not deletion (filtering out). There is a pseudo-tag for identifying those questions, namely the &quot;unanswered&quot; tab at the top. There's no answer for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/6433/ipa-for-slender-irish-r-in-connemara-dialects&quot;&gt;Slender r question&lt;/a&gt;, nor &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/23309/combinatory-categorial-grammar-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0-develop&quot;&gt;комбинаторная категориальная грамматика&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/26136/are-there-any-languages-that-either-effectively-dont-have-verbs-or-that-somehow&quot;&gt;don't have verbs&lt;/a&gt; question.

We already have a bit of a problem with suboptimal communication of the &quot;language specific&quot; reason, so it would be a good thing to be clear about what's okay and what's not okay. In fact, it would be manifestly unfair to ban questions from &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; who are creating constructed languages, instead we should ban certain kinds of questions. Here are some example questions (with commentary).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1: &quot;I'm working on a conlang. How frequently do SOV languages have AN word order?&quot; (The second sentence is a legitimate question: does the first assertion poison the question?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2: &quot;I want my conlang to have VOS word order and case marking. Should the case marking be a prefix or a suffix?&quot; (I think this ought to even be off topic for a conlang site, since there's no basis for holding either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to be correct – pure opinion).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3: &quot;Would there be any problem if I build my conlang so that it is uttered during inhalation rather than exhalation?&quot; (A more clever questioner would have asked &quot;are there any languages that are uttered during inhalation rather than exhalation, and if not, why not?&quot;, and could have applied that to their conlang in private).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4: &quot;I constructed a conlang 5 years ago, and there are a couple dozen speakers. I'm thinking of adding features to the language. What do you think of these additions...&quot; (I'm taking advantage of the fact that there are speakers, which I might think licenses asking any questions at all).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that all questions about conlangs are off topic, except factual questions about the structure of an existing conlang (with speakers). Though except for Esperanto and Klingon, I don't know what conlangs have speakers, so it's not clear that the &quot;with speaker&quot; criterion is useful. I think the restriction should be about there being a way to actually verify an answer, such as a published grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with &lt;a href=&quot;https://linguistics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1781/6726&quot;&gt;the disagreement&lt;/a&gt; (not trying to encourage an infinite regress). Put very simply, there is no reasonable and answerable question about conlangs that cannot be framed strictly as a question about natural languages. If you want to decide whether to make your conlang VOS, you should decide privately how that question could ever be answered objectively. If you want the language to exhibit the least-frequent properties of human languages (or the most frequent), then ask a question about natural language. Don't ask for opinions about what you should do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also disagree with the position that linguistics is specifically the study of any given language. Linguistics is the study of the nature of language, and not the accumulation of studies of individual languages. Linguistics is not the social history of the word &quot;meat&quot; in English, it is not about normative judgments such as the prohibition against &quot;ain't&quot;, it is not about programming tips for text mining, and it is not answers to questions like &quot;What is the accusative plural of 'horse' in Sanskrit?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The implication that we are trying to impose a world view on innocent people is wrong (&quot;people have an agenda and try to impose it on others as though they're not allowed to ask questions here&quot;). There is a huge difference between a focused Q&amp;amp;A website, and an open ended discussion forum. If you want an open-ended discussion where all comments are equal, then go to a discussion forum, and not a fact-seeking site. The very reason why SE exists at all is that there are technical questions which need answering by knowledgeable people. The rules of SE are there to preserve the function of SE, to keep it from turning into a discussion forum which just accumulates personal opinions. &lt;strong&gt;Of course&lt;/strong&gt; there are questions that you are not supposed to ask here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastEditorUserId="6726" LastEditDate="2018-02-14T16:33:03.667" LastActivityDate="2018-02-14T16:33:03.667" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Linguistics is specifically the study of any given language, no matter its origin. For people to come and ask about languages or the like, they need a community of people who know what language is. World building is its own subject, elsewhere, and has nothing to do with language or the creation of a language. Character, too, is its own subject, and so for people in psychology to propose that questions about literary characters in terms of their behavior or say their countenances go to some other forum if to ask their questions about character is just absurd. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember that I recently asked a question about language patterns themselves, which couldn't be any more concrete given the context of my question, as in grammar is a pattern of numerous human languages, or words themselves; yet another pattern in languages, all across the world. So words would be a pattern, grammar a pattern, etc. And, when I come to see that this is your idea on the forum, it makes perfect sense that you actually marked my question as &quot;too vague.&quot; It's attitudes just like this that don't belong in such communities where experts and amateurs alike discuss.

My own rationalization of that ban is that it's a version of the principle &quot;We don't do your homework for you&quot;.

SE explicitly favors down-voting questions as contrasted with answers (and not that there is no up-vote reward). There is a non-generous interpretation of how multiple down-votes arise in cases where a question is not egregiously bad (blood in the water analogies), which is similar to serial close-voting. I think that is just the way it is on SE, and it's not obvious what there is that could be looked into. I question the assertion that down-voting is not related to content (how do you know it is?), and I suggest you consider the alternative explanation of ideological voting (it's not the structure of the argument, it's the viewpoint that you reflect). Ideological voting is not exactly rare on SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not that I dispute the premise that there exists personal animus (or adoration) as a basis for voting, it's that I don't see that this is a solvable problem under the SE model of content evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastActivityDate="2020-01-06T18:09:12.347" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The other top downvoters on you as well as your top upvoters have much lower percentages (&amp;lt;= 25%).

However, inspecting the votes received reveals that the user in question seems to have up to five sockpuppet accounts on this site (significant cross-upvoting and shared IP-addresses).

There are no comments associated with the question that indicate a reason for closing: what you can know is that 5 people VTC'd, at least one person clicked the &quot;Language-specific grammar&quot; box, possibly the first person did so, and maybe all 5 agreed with that assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no standardized or official guidance on what constitutes language-specific grammar, and no bright lines. Statistically-speaking, there are numerous strategies that might be followed to avoid this closure reason, which could increase the chances that some such question would survive. You should focus on the fact that linguistics is a general scientific discipline studying the nature of human language as a cognitive phenomenon, which ultimately means that we're devising a general theory of the language faculty. Language-learning mnemonics aimed at learning quirks of some language (the &quot;CaReFuL&quot; mnemonic for interpreting final consonants in French spelling) are not within the scope of linguistics. An understanding of rules of glide deletion and vocalization in Classical Arabic is within the scope of linguistics, and may (some possibility) have utility to the untrained language-learner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this is not the logically most-obvious reason, the first problem is that it is addressed to a very small set of specialists within linguistics. I don't know what &quot;ברוך הבא&quot; says – I think the first letter is aleph, so questions like this don't even get a read from me. A first step to making the question more general is to transliterate the data. A second step is to shed illusions about literal meaning – why not just accept that &quot;ברוך הבא&quot; means &quot;Welcome&quot;? What do you really want to know? What does בָּא have to do with the question? It appears that your &quot;real&quot; question is about the historical source of this expression. As a linguistic matter, either this is a canned construction, or it is a productive construction just as &quot;buys watercress&quot; would be a freshly-constructed collocation in English. What are you really asking (we used to call that &quot;unclear what you're asking&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A third problem is revealed in your suggestion that &quot;the phrase literally means 'Blessed be the comer' instead of 'The comer is blessed'&quot;, which is that &quot;ברוך הבא&quot; means &quot;רוך הבא&quot;, and strings like &quot;Blessed be the comer&quot; do not constitute the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of expressions in Hebrew, they are (possibly) a &lt;em&gt;translation&lt;/em&gt; into English. And maybe (or maybe not) one translation into English better captures the meaning of some expression in some language better than a competing translation does. What real-word semantic difference do you think underlies the difference between 'Blessed be the comer' instead of 'The comer is blessed'? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't extract anything that is about the language faculty from this discussion, but I can imagine ways in which the question could be narrowed to a more-linguistic topic, regarding language change, syntax and semantics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6726" LastActivityDate="2020-06-07T16:48:10.207" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
